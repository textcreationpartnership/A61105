            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THe outward figure of this book, is like the diſh called an Oleo, a Meſs of all together, which I have ſo compoſed on purpoſe to give content to every appetite, at leaſt to ſome. If any do nauſeate the whole Meſs, let ſuch conſider whether the fault be in the platter, or in their palate. I have formed it in way of a Dialogue, becauſe it is an inquiſitive age, and alſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch kind of writing comes off more quick and home to the underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, then long diſcourſes, which oftentimes wearieth the Reader, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founds the memory. The matter of it is univerſall and generall, that people may find in it ſomething of every thing that obviouſly comes into their ears or mind; for all which with their appendences, I refer thee to the Table at the end, but rather to the diligent reading of the book it ſelfe, whoſe Erra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta in the Printing, are ſet down at the end alſo. The quotations of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture I deſire thee to ſearch and read, becauſe I have omitted the words of the Text, leſt the volume ſwell too big. Let me intreat thee to read and judge favourably,<note place="margin">Greg. Naz.</note> though I had rather my friend ſhould uſe his liberty, then my ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my flatter me. The end why I wrote this tract, is becauſe I have beheld with aſad heart, the tares of diviſion ſprung up too thick in this our field, or Church, of late years, by which is bred many hereſies in Pariſhes, and many ſchiſms among Miniſters. I know that there be pieces more accurately written upon many things diſcourſed of in this book, but they be diſperſed in divers volumes, and many know not where to find them. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I have collected many, and directed thee to more. So that I hope this my poor pains may stay ſome that ſtagger, and recall ſome that wander, and ſo help to nouriſh Chriſtian communion which is almoſt loſt.

So in the fifth verſe, ſaith he, <hi>When we are at home in the body, we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from the Lord,</hi> and therefore are willing to be abſent from the body, to be preſent with the Lord, therefore he deſired <hi>to be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and to be with Chriſt.</hi> And St <hi>Stephen</hi> praieth God to receive his ſpirit.

And again, if the ſoul were diſſolved at death, in vain did Chriſt warn us not to <hi>feare them that kill the body,</hi> or him that can damn the ſoul; For what <hi>damnum</hi> or damage can there be to him, that after death hath no ſoul to feel either ſorrow of loſſe, or pain of ſenſe.</p>

                  <p>You propound too faſt, one of theſe three is enough at once, and eſpecially the firſt to know what the ſoul is, ſince Chriſt ſaith, it hath been with us ever ſince we were born, and yet we know not
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:37858:13"/>what it is. But I ſuppoſe he meaneth that we know it not by any perfect knowledge we have of the eſſence thereof; for it is hard to know that by which we know any thing, yet we may know it by its operation; for no doubt it is an immateriall or ſpiritual ſubſtance, which gives man (next to God) life, ſenſe, motion, and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. How we came by this ſoule at firſt in our firſt parents, muſt be underſtood from God, who gives beginning to all things; but how we have them ſince, may be a queſtion; for though he made our firſt parents by creation, yet he makes us mediately by generation of our parents; but whether ſoule and body, is a queſtion too, and yet we ſay one man begets another, and if the whole man, then body and ſoule, but if the body only, then is but halfe the man begotten by the parents: Some think all ſouls were at firſt created,<note place="margin">Plato.</note> and are reſerved as in a treaſury, I know not where, and infuſed at mans generation, or when the body is apt to receive them, but then it is not the form of man, nor doth work in the forming of mans body from his concepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on if it be not infuſed till the body be apt for it, which they count forty daies after the conception: Others,<note place="margin">Hilary.</note> that God creates it of no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, <hi>ex tempore,</hi> upon every occaſion of the females conception; but then ſay others, God is put to a new creation every day:<note place="margin">Zanchius.</note> Some ſay that God gives it eſſence and ſubſtance, but the parents give it a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of being and exiſtence. Many, or moſt of the Fathers did judge that it was created of God immediatly, and infuſed, yet Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> makes a ſtand at it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> in epiſt. act <hi>Hieron. 28.</hi> de orig. peccato.</note> becauſe he finds not how originall ſin can be conveied, if the ſoul come not by the parents to the child by propagation; for if the body come only from them, meer matter is not capable of ſin, neither is the body alone a perſon, and ſo no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of man is tainted with originall ſin in conception, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. <hi>In ſin my mother conceived</hi> (not my body only) but <hi>me;</hi> and if God make the ſoule of nothing and then infuſeth it, then it being of it ſelfe pure by his creation, how can it ſtand with Gods juſtice to pour it into a tain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted body; and if the body as meer matter cannot be ſinfull, nor the ſoule neither being newly ſet out of Gods hand, then meer uniting cannot make them ſo, and then we ſhall find no originall ſin at all. Theſe opinions being not plainly concluded by the Scripture nor the<note n="*" place="margin">Yet in Saint <hi>Hieromes</hi> time the Weſtern Church was much inclined this way.</note> Church; therefore as we are to hold that which Scripture, reaſon, or experience holdeth forth to us moſt evidently; ſo where ſuch evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is not, we are to hold that which is moſt probable, which if we will not do, I ſee no reaſon but we muſt be content without rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Now the Scriptures do not plainly evidence that the ſoule is immediately created of God, and ſo infuſed, but rather offers it as a thing not altogether from God, nor altogether from man, as you may ſee by divers phraſes in Scripture, as in <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.27. <hi>Be fruitfull, and multiply, and fill the earth (viz.)</hi> that is, with mankind, and perſons of men as other creatures were to do, <hi>ver.</hi> 22. of that Chapter, or elſe Gods word is not ſo effectuall in man the more excellent creature, as it is in the beaſts, all which he intended by his reſting from creating, that they ſhould ever perſiſt of themſelves, and multiply their kinds: Of which God gave the firſt inſtance when he framed <hi>Eve</hi> the firſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:37858:14"/>woman out of the firſt man; and yet is not ſaid to breath into her as into <hi>Adam,</hi> a breath of life, ſilently arguing, that by his power con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curring, her whole ſubſtance was taken from <hi>Adam,</hi> upon whom he had firſt and originally breathed<note n="*" place="margin">Spiraculum animarum.</note> the breath of ſouls, as the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall text reads it; yet other texts ſhew us alſo that God hath an eſpeciall hand in it, as <hi>Job</hi> 10.8, 10. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.13, 15. <hi>Thy hands have made me: Thou haſt covered me in my mothers womb.</hi> And <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> brings in God aſſerting, that he formed him in the womb, and <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. It is ſaid God formeth the ſpirit of a man within him; he doth not ſay creates it of nothing, but he brings that into act, which was there in the ſeed,<note place="margin">Ariſt.</note> but potentially, as <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> held not much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſe, though he leaves it doubtfull whether it be mortall or immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall; ſo that we ſee both God and man hath an hand in the generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the whole man together.</p>

                  <p>Some ſeem againſt it, but are not ſo, as <hi>Exod.</hi> 21.22, &amp;c. that a man <hi>if he hurt a woman with child, and her fruit depart from her, and yet miſchief or death follow not, i.</hi> upon the mother, then the puniſhment ſhal be but a fine or mulct; but if miſchiefe or <hi>death follow, then he ſhall pay life for life.</hi> Now if this miſchiefe or death be underſtood of the woman, this place argueth nothing to the ſouls production by propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. If it be meant of the child, then it muſt have life, and how a reaſonable creature can have life without the form of it, <hi>viz.</hi> a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſoule, I know not; therefore the judgement ſurely was to be made upon the child quickning, and ſo life was to anſwer for life; but whether the ſoule be not infuſed before, even at the conception, is ſtill queſtionable. So <hi>Numb.</hi> 27.16. he is called <hi>the God of ſpirits,</hi> yet is he not alſo the God of our bodies? yes ſure, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifie God in your bodies, for they are Gods.</hi> But <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.7. ſeemeth to make a greater difference, for the body is ſaid there to <hi>return to the duſt, but the ſpirit to God that gave it;</hi> yet this proves only the ſoules
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:37858:14"/>immortall eſtate after death, not any immediate creation of it, except he relates to <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe creation was immediate of duſt, and his ſoule immediate from God, but our bodies are not ſo, and the queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſtill remains, whether the ſoule be not conveied by Gods ſpeciall concurrence in propagation. So <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.16. it is ſaid of God, <hi>I will not alwaies contend, leſt the ſoules that I have made, faile before me;</hi> but that is meant by the generall life of all creatures: Beſide, who know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not that God makes us, we teach our children ſo to anſwer us in their Catechiſme, becauſe God did it originally, and doth it ſtill by his benediction of parentall ſeed, yet we know alſo that the parents beget the children. So <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. it is ſaid, <hi>all ſouls are mine;</hi> but that is, all perſons. So <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.1. It is ſaid, <hi>God formeth the ſpirit of man with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him,</hi> which no man will deny; but the queſtion is ſtill of what, whether of nothing, or of the parents ſubſtance corporall and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall: Indeed that place of <hi>Zachary</hi> intends the firſt mans forming, as we ſee by his alledging Gods ſtretching forth of the heavens, and lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation of the earth, which was at the creation; or if he meaneth the ſouls of men ſince the creation, then by forming cannot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

But you will ſay that God is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Father of Spirits,</hi> in oppoſition to the fathers of our fleſh; but the oppoſition is not made there between God and man, or ſoule and body, but between naturall life, and caſuall correction, and ſpirituall; but be it meant of God and naturall parents, yet it proves nothing to the ſouls production, for he is the God of our body, as well as of our ſpirits.</p>

                  <p>It followeth not; for the corruption of the ſoule in propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is only a mutation from power to act, and ſo is not corrupted by putrefaction, but advanced by perfection; it is the ſame as it was, but not in the ſame manner as it was, and ſo the ſoul propagated is not corrupted; nor is the ſoule propagating corrupted, for it is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther divided nor diminiſhed, no more then the flame of a lamp is by lighting another.</p>

                  <p>Not ſo, for the ſoule is never procreated but in conception, namely, when the ſeed of male and female meet in one together,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:37858:15"/>with the efficient power of God concurring with all naturall cauſes for the production thereof; therefore when conceptions faile, the ſoule continueth as it was; ſo in unlawfull copulations with other creatures (God not conferring his power) no rationall creature is brought forth, but the ſoule remains without communication of it ſelfe.</p>

                  <p>If it be found in Scripture, or by juſt conſequence drawn therefrom, then it may be founded on true Religion: And that it is ſo, I find, 1. By Gods inſtitution, <hi>Increaſe, multiply, and fill the earth,</hi>

We find that God ſo or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered nature in the creation, that every thing in nature ſhould perſiſt by themſelves, and multiply their kinds, that he might make no new creatures after that he ceaſed from all his work which he had made. 3.

But ſurely I underſtand not if the ſoule be immediatly created, how it can be corrupted or made ſinfull; for from whence ſhould the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption ariſe; from the ſoule it cannot being created good; from the body it cannot, being meer matter, neither capable of vertue or vice, becauſe it wants intellect, will and affection: If you ſay it ariſeth from union, how can that be if the ſoul be created good, and the body be uncapable of evill: If you ſay it comes by imputation, you make God to do and undo, to give good, and take it away again without cauſe, and ſo an unjuſt, at leaſt a vain work, to give goodneſſe to the ſoule, and preſently to take it away again by infuſing it or uniting it to the body, by which it ſhould become ſinfull. I know ſome will ſay God may impute it to man for <hi>Adam</hi>'s fall, as well as righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to us for Chriſts merits; but friend, the caſe is much unlike; for imputation of righteouſneſſe is a work of mercy, which is to be done without cauſe; but the imputation of ſin is a work of juſtice which canot be done without ſome cauſe; but if the ſoule be created pure, and the body untainted with ſin, both becauſe it is meer matter, and ſin of a ſpirituall nature, which cannot taint meer paſſive matter, then can there be no ground for imputation, and ſo it cannot paſſe but by propagation.</p>

Now Chriſt did not take her perſon but ſubſtance, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly leaving the accident of ſin, which adhereth only to a perſon; and ſo though Chriſts nature were in <hi>Adam,</hi> and ſo in the Virgin who was of that ſinfull line, yet his perſon was in neither; for he was the eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall ſon of God, who in that inſtant that the humane nature was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived or ſeparated by the holy Ghoſt from the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> did aſſume it into himſelfe to be one perſon; and thus his nature could never be tainted with originall ſin; for his humane nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that was never a perſon, and when it was a perſon, it was propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated not after the ordinary and naturall way, and ſo without ſin: Nay more, the ſubſtance of his humane nature though it were ſinfull, ſubſiſting in the bleſſed Virgins perſon, yet ſo it could not be Chriſts, becauſe perſonality cannot be imparted, but it was made his by ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration from her by the holy Ghoſt, and his own immediate aſſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſo great is the myſtery of Godlineſſe, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.16. The not conceiving this rightly, made the Marcionites and Manicheans ſay, Chriſt had no true body; and Apollinaris to ſay he had no hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane ſoule.</p>

                  <p>Mans ſoveraign and chiefeſt good, conſiſteth in the enjoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, which confers to man concurrence of all good, without any contrarieties, which is oppoſed to that miſery into which he is fallen by the firſt mans ſin, namely, blindneſſe of mind, fondneſſe of affection, ſtubbornneſſe of will, inclineableneſſe to all evill, way ward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe from all good, for which cauſe we are ſubjected to vanity, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptibilitie, all miſeries of body and ſoul, temporal and eternall, death and damnation. Now mans felicity is an eſtate contrary to all theſe: After this many learned Philoſophers ſearched, but could not find it, and why? Becauſe they knew not God from whom it proceeds, and is the giver of it by redeeming man from all miſery, and from death to life by his free grace in Chriſt, which is <hi>life eternall and true felicity to know aright.</hi> John 17.3.</p>

                  <p>Not the principles of nature only; for they teach no fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than there is a felicity, but not what it is, which made the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers in ſuch a labyrinth about it; ſome placing it in pleaſure, ſome in poverty,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Varro.</note> ſome in knowledge, ſome in riches, ſome in honours, as many people doe now: For as ſome aim at no end or mark at all, but like fooliſh children ſhoot their arrowes up in the aire; ſome aim at a bad end in which can be no happineſſe; ſome at a ſeeming good which is not good in it ſelfe; ſome at felicity in generall, but go blind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and lamely about it, wanting right leading principles.</p>
                  <p>The principles are ſuch therefore as God hath revealed, who is in himſelfe the chiefeſt good, and therefore can beſt ordaine the way whereby man may enjoy him. This way is ſet down in the holy Scriptures; for which Scriptures ſake the world was made, that ſo in time that might be revealed,<note place="margin">Polanus.</note> which in God was hidden at the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, namely, that Chriſt ſhould come and redeem mankind from the wrath of God, the ſlavery of Satan, and the dominion of ſin and death, which rightly to know and beleeve, leads to life eternall.</p>

                  <p>By right underſtanding the holy Scriptures in its propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and conſequences. Now the Scripture tels us that the firſt man ſinned, and ſo incurred the wrath of God upon himſelfe and all his poſterity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. yet he ſo graciouſly promiſed him that the ſeed of the woman ſhould break the ſerpents head, <hi>i.</hi> ruine the policies and works of the Devill, wrought in and againſt man. Now from whence
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:37858:17"/>commeth this? doth God intend to put up this wrong, and paſſe it over? then how can his juſtice be ſatisfied? or if infinite juſtice muſt be ſatisfied by ſome ſuffering for that ſin, then who muſt undergo it: If we look upon God as abſolutely one without diſtinction, then the offended muſt mediate with himſelfe, and ſo put up this offence; yea, the Father God muſt be the ſufferer without any mediator.<note place="margin">Gnoſticks, <hi>or</hi> Patriſpaſſiani.</note> But this cannot be; for a mediator is not of one, but God is one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20. yet infinite juſtice muſt be ſatisfied by an infinite perſon. The ſcriptures therefore declare, that in the Godhead there be three perſons, Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Son, and holy Ghoſt. Now though we cannot ſo well appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend how the eſſence divine can mediate to it ſelfe for man, yet we may conceive how one perſon can mediate to another, and ſo that the Son who lay hid in the boſome of the Father before all time, did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult and mediate with the Father about it. We muſt therefore un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand firſt, That God made man as perfect as a creature rationall could be made, ſaving only that he gave him not immutability, which is a portion beyond created nature: For the very Angels that ſtood once, were yet mutable in themſelves, and they that ſtand now are not immutable in themſelves, though they be in their eſtate, and the reaſon is, they that fell choſe to ſtand by their own naturall power, without dependency upon God; they that ſtood choſe to ſtand by dependency upon the Archangell the Son of God, the firſt born of every creature,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.15.</note> and of whom the whole family of heaven and earth is named, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.15. theſe were the elect Angels. Now as they ſtood by love, ſo man muſt be recovered by faith in him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> Servans hos, ſalvens illos.</note> that is the ſame Archangell and Son of God, Jeſus Chriſt, who is the head of men and Angels, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. creating both; but preſerving them, and ſaving us from all the bitter effects of ſin, and leading us to eternall ſelicity, by grace on earth, to glory in heaven. This is the way to felicity; firſt, To know God, Then ſecondly, my ſelfe and miſerable condition, and thirdly, The remedy in Chriſt.</p>

                  <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
                  <p>The reaſon of it is; firſt, The ſin of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> who ſought to find the chief good in that which God the chiefe good pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited. Mans ſoule is troubled with a vertigo ever ſince, and run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning round in a maze, is not able to find the right object, and if any time we come neer it, yet like the Sun comming to his verticall point in the tropick, we turn back to the old courſe. Some men know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of felicity, yet they aime at ſomething they fanſie to be good for them; yea, at a kind of immortality, as in writing, building, or to practiſe Arts or Arms, or purchaſing and conquering; all which are but ſhadowes of felicity, and may keep our names alive, while the ſoule may be damn'd as the body is dead. Some are worſe, that place their felicity in carnall delights; as in cating drinking,<note place="margin">Phil. 3.19.</note> and wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſſe, which ends commonly in bitterneſſe, ſhame and death. Now though that felicity is thus divorſed by mans miſtakings, running round in a large circumference of mans vain apprehenſions, yet by ſerious conſideration it may be reduced to one centrall point; for when we have wearied our ſelves, like <hi>Noah</hi>'s Dove we muſt return
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:37858:18"/>to the Ark at laſt for reſt and ſafety, for only in God the ſoule takes reſt,<note place="margin">Aratus.</note> for as we are the off-ſpring of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.27, 28. ſo he is not far from any of us, and we may find him by nature if we would grope after him: but eſpecially by Scripture which teacheth us to know God in Chriſt; for none can come to the father but by him, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe we know not felicity at all, or not rightly; for as no man can divide a circle till he have found the center; ſo neither the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of true felicity, till we fix the foot of our affection in God, like one foot of a compaſſe: And as a man may find the center of a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle though he ſeeth it not; ſo may one find God in the circumference of his works, though he never ſaw him, and felicity in Chriſt though he never yet knew it before.</p>

                  <p>I ſuppoſe you urge not this queſtion becauſe you doubt it, but becauſe you would have reaſon to ſatisfie others therein; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that there is a God fit to be known of all men, I ſhall prove by reaſon; for though Scriptures be enough to prove it to us that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve, yet not to them who beleeve not; therefore reaſon in this point is needfull; for many will not beleeve unleſſe their underſtanding be over-powred by miracle, or revelation, or by ſome extraordinary energeticall operation of God upon the ſoule, they will not beleeve except their reaſon be convinced of the truth of Scriptures, that they are of God, and of divine revelation; otherwiſe he thinks that his faith is but implicit, or folded up in other mens beleefe, or a weak yielding to antiquity or authority of Lawes and Cuſtomes, without examination of their analogy and agreement with pure and primary reaſon; and I beleeve if pure reaſon were not clouded by idleneſſe, ignorance, or wilfulneſſe, it would prove a more impartiall judge of truth, than the Pope himſelfe, who beleeves the Scripture by the ground of antiquity, and forceth his concluſions drawn therefrom, upon mens conſciences by his own authority; which men being made his vaſſals, yield to any thing for quietneſſe ſake, though themſelves have no ſatisfaction therein. From whence it is that moſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans profeſſion of Religion, is but either forced by fear of authority, or voluntarily reſigned up to another mans judgement, or ſetled upon ones obſtinate wilfulneſſe, neither which is ſaving faith: For though we give ſome aſſent to Scriptures at firſt being moved by the autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Church, to whom we owe reſpect and reverence, as the people of <hi>Samaria</hi> firſt beleeved for the womans ſake,<note place="margin">John 4.42.</note> yet at laſt they beleeved for Chriſts ſake: So people within the pale of the Church, firſt hear the voice of their mother the Church, but at laſt they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve it for God the Fathers ſake, whoſe voice they find ſpeak in Scripture, which is the foundation of true faith, being the laſt principle into which faith can be reſolved.</p>

                  <p>None better then Scripture to them that beleeve it; but
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:37858:18"/>becauſe many beleeve not the Scriptures; as the Heathen denie the whole Bible, and the Jewes halfe of it, namely, the N. T. therefore reaſon muſt be found to convince ſuch. The heathen know not the true God, and the Jews know not God in Chriſt, and ſo one worſhips a falſe God, and the other the true God but in a falſe manner: And we need not ſcruple at reaſon in this point, becauſe God gave reaſon before Scriptures, and holy Reaſon before holy Writ to divers men which lead them to Religion; and therefore though it be well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to us out of the Old Teſtament, that there is a God of the Jewes, whom the very Heathen feared, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 4.7, 8. And alſo out of the New Teſtament, that to us there is but one true God, of whom are all things, and we in him; and one Lord Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 8.6.</note> by whom are all things, and we by him: And beſide, we know that nothing can teſtifie better of the truth of Gods being, then the truth of Gods wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting; yet for other mens ſakes who beleeve not the Scriptures, and yet by reaſon may be induced to beleeve them, it is good to urge rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Now the firſt reaſon to perſwade men that there is a God, is; Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ſeems written in the minds of all nations by a naturall impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or mentall preſumption, which forceth rather to worſhip any thing for a god, then no god at all;<note place="margin">

                     </note> which ſheweth the firſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement written in their hearts, that they ſhall acknowledge a god, though what god it is they know not, and ſo they worſhip divers things for gods which are not ſo. From hence it is that ſome have worſhipped Sun and Moon; ſome worſhipped Beaſts, Serpents; ſome the Images of Men; ſome Crocodiles; ſome Devils under ſtrange ſhapes of Satyrs, whoſe upper part was manlike, and the under part like a Goat; the Aegyptians worſhip<note n="*" place="margin">Shor-apis.</note> an Oxe head; the Bramenes of India, worſhip the firſt thing they meet in the morning, as the god of the day:<note place="margin">Orteli Coſm.</note> So in Baida they worſhip a piece of a red clout ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a croſſe-ſtick like a banner; ſome worſhip a Croſſe as the god of raine: This may be ſome old traditions of the Croſſe antiquated. I would they that underſtand their language, would bring that God to them whom they ignorantly worſhip, as <hi>Paul</hi> did to the Athenians, it would prove a happy voiage. I know the Papiſts uſe ſome endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours among them to little purpoſe, till they have convinced their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and ſo they do but draw them from one ſuperſtition to another, and can give as little reaſon for one as the other; yea, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve the ſubtill Indian obſerving the Idolatry of the Papiſts, think their own Religion to be as good as the Papiſts.</p>

                  <p>Through ignorance, and immoderate paſſions of love and fear: For as through ignorance ſome worſhipped Fortune, and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as contumely and impudence, as did the Athenians,<note place="margin">Clem. Rom. l. <hi>5.</hi> Recog.</note> others <hi>Flora</hi> and <hi>Priapus,</hi> as did the Romans, ſome worſhipped <hi>Nymphae</hi> and <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men,</hi> and <hi>Mons Veneris,</hi> which words ſignifie the ſecret parts of wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens bodies, fo which they made gods and goddeſſes, as ſome ina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured Gallants do of their miſtreſſes. And thus the Devill hath taught men to debaſe themſelves even unto hell, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57.9. So by fear
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:37858:19"/>men worſhipped Serpents and Crocodiles, and other hurtfull crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; as the Indians do the Devill for fear he ſhould harm them; others worſhipped the Images of both under certain ſhapes called Teleſmes, which were made to defend them from ſomething they feared. So Love erected ſtrange Idols: As thoſe that paſſionately deſired to preſerve the memory of their friends, did after their death ſet up an Image of them, which in proceſſe became a ſanctuary for offenders;<note place="margin">Dioph. Laced. in Antiq.</note> as did the Image of <hi>Synophanes</hi> ſon, which he ſet up in love of his memory, to which Image his ſervants offered incenſe, and did fly to it for pardon of their offended maſter, and upon reliefe would offer it gifts of thankfulneſſe. From hence came ſuperſtition, the end whereof was,<note place="margin">Cicero.</note> that their friends might be ſuperſtites or ſurvivors when they were dead; that is, kept in memory after death. So <hi>Ninus</hi> ſet up the Image of <hi>Belus</hi> his father, in his new built City <hi>Niniveh,</hi> which became a ſanctuary to all kind of offenders, and in proceſſe of time came to be religious worſhip,<note place="margin">Sophocles.</note> which even ſome heathen Poets confuted.

And it is very likely that <hi>Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzars</hi> golden Image, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.38. was to be a memoriall of himſelfe, becauſe <hi>Daniel</hi> had told him that he was the head of Gold; but God croſſed his purpoſe by the delivering of the three children from the fiery furnace. However his Babylonians ſet up their god Bel, which is very likely that they had brought from the Aſſyrians by conqueſt.</p>

By miſtakes of men, who writing againſt the heathen gods, have been thought to deny all Godhead. So <hi>Diagoras</hi> rather denied the Athenian gods, than denied the true God.

                  <p>As much as any reaſonable man can deſire; and that is the impreſſions of it upon his works and his gifts, and in the minds of men.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. He hath given three principles of all bodies, airie, watry,<note place="margin">Chymiſts ſay, Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury.</note> and earthy matter, and three kind of lives or ſouls, the vegetative or growing life or ſoule to plants: The ſenſitive, with vegetation to bruits, the rationall, with both the former to men; but eſpecially the Image of God in the firſt man, argued the three perſons immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality, wiſedome, and freedome. So to the rationall ſoule three prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall faculties, the Underſtanding, the Will, and the power of act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. So Arts which are Gods gifts, ſome of them ſheweth his unity; as Geometry draweth all lines from one point; and Arithmetick from a unite draweth all numbers; ſo Aſtronomy, all motions from the firſt mover; ſo Muſick, a rare gift of God, ariſeth from uniſon, and three concords and diſcords, arguing a unity in Trinity.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But above all theſe three Arts by which we expreſſe our ſouls (which have an impreſſe of the Deity) ſets forth the Trinity, as they proceed one from the other. For Grammer is the fountain of them by letters which makes words. Logick of words frameth ſence, and Rhetorick by help of both, maketh an oration. So the Son is the word of the Father, and the Holy Ghoſt proceeds from them both; and therefore the Cabaliſts ſaid, that before God revealed himſelfe in his operations, he was like a dark ſolitary letter,<note place="margin">Aleph tenebro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="3">3. He hath imprinted this Trinity in the minds of men, as well as the unity of the Godhead: Which made ſome learned men ſay,<note place="margin">Pythago.

                  <p>Beſide, he makes all things but by a threefold vertue; his Power, Wiſedome, and Love, a repreſentative of the three perſons.

<pb n="26" facs="tcp:37858:24"/>knowledge of God in man, ariſeth from the depravation of his affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, which deſires to know God ſenſibly, as men behold Princes, which cannot be in this world,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> no more then fleſh and blood can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit heaven till it be mortified by death, and fermented in the grave, and refined at the reſurrection. <hi>Moſes</hi> deſire was exuberant to ſee Gods glory in viſible appearance: For though God was pleaſed to be repreſented by Angels in ſhapes of men in the Old Teſtament, yet he hath no ſhape; <hi>For to what will ye liken me ſaith God?</hi> 3.

Becauſe we find all things fall alike to all, and a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall ſucceſſion of things to be as they were alwaies; ſo they think we are all born at adventure, and all things come by nature or fortune. 5. It comes by the devils craft, deluding men with vanity, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them not to think of God, and ſo bold to perpetrate horrible ſins, through blindneſſe and hardneſſe of heart, whereas if they did but conſider Gods waies and footſteps in Scripture, in making all things, and in diſpoſing them to their ſeverall ends and orders; the rare knowledge given to man above other creatures; the peace of his mind when he doth well; the terrors of his conſcience in doing ill; the impreſſion and ſtamp of <hi>Elohim</hi> upon his Magiſtrates, whom he calleth Gods; the ſtrange vengeance following wicked men, to them whom temporall Judges either do not, or cannot puniſh. Beſides, prodigious ſigns in heaven of future calamities: So to ſee monſtrous births, terrible earthquakes, which though they have naturall and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond cauſes, yet why they are not alwaies, or oftner, or not at all, or in this place more then that, muſt needs be the rule of ſome ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our power.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:37858:24"/>enough he was the oldeſt writer of divine Revelation, if not of any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He lived in the time of <hi>Cecrops</hi> King of <hi>Athens.</hi>

                  <p>If we beleeve the hiſtory to be a divine truth, we cannot well doubt of the doctrinall part being interſerted one with another, and both of them equally atteſted by divine miracles, both of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles, which miracles being from the divine power, would never have been produced to atteſt falſe doctrines in Scriptures; therefore the Scriptures, in doctrine, as well as in hiſtory, is the word of God. But beſide the rare modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:37858:25"/>of them ſheweth them no leſſe: For though they tranſcend rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, yet they deliver nothing contrary to right and pure reaſon, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing contrary in nature, though things above nature.

                  <p>You may eaſily anſwer theſe thus.

Hence is the Word perſonall; and ſo Chriſt is the word begotten before all worlds, by whom the world and all things were made, and he is called God. 3. Hence is the Word prophorical, or enuntiative, which God giveth by his ſpirit divers waies to men; as by viſions, dreams, inſpiration, and by an audible voice, this is not called properly God, though the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of it, the holy Spirit, be God.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe words is immanent, and conſultative. The ſecond is emanent and generative. The third is proceedent and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative, and therefore communicates Gods will declaratively to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine

By way of negation, and ſo whatſoever deficiency I find in the Creature, I deny any jot of it to be in God. 3.

There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as God the Father hath life in himſelfe, ſo hath he given the Sonne to have life in himſelfe, and this life is the light of men, and through the energie of the ſpirit, quickneth all things that hath life: For as God made the Sun to be the center of light naturall, ſo he hath ordained Chriſt to be the center of life naturall in the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and alſo the center of ſpirituall life in regeneration, by which we come to be partakers of the divine nature, and ſo finally of life eternally. 2.

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:37858:29"/>or wicked men, but reſolve to endure with patience, becauſe they are permitted by the wiſe God for ends beſt known to himſelfe: for he knowes of them, ſees and ſmiles at the madneſſe of men, who like fooliſh children deſire of their fathers, knives and daggers, which ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving got, they wound others, and themſelves worſt. 3. By Gods wil, is ſignified Gods infinite free approbation, or diſallowance of what he wiſely knoweth, to be approved or diſallowed; ſo that he nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther begins to will what once he would not, nor can be hindred to do what he will. Now this will hath divers terms in Scripture, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the divers objects of it. As 1.

So Love, becauſe he is willing to approve what is good, and to be well pleaſed with it. So hatred, becauſe he is not willing to allow evill, but is moſt willing to puniſh it, becauſe he doth deteſt it. So his juſtice, becauſe he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely willing to do right, as to reward the good, and puniſh the evill. So his mercy, becauſe he is infinitely willing and ready to pitty the miſerable, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.11. So his wrath, becauſe he is inclinable in his will to puniſh ſinners. So his purity ſheweth his will is bent to love holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, but to hate all filthineſſe both of fleſh and ſpirit. 4. His pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſheweth that he is infinitely endowed with efficacious faculty to do whatſoever he will; for there is no limit to his power but his will.

                  <p>God before the world lay hid both in his eſſence and ſubſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, yet being a Trinity coeſſentiall in Unity, with afflux, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined in time to ſhew himſelfe to be Unity in Trinity, by ema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and by energeticall operations in nature, grace and glory; the Father appearing as the fountain of nature, the Son as the fountain of grace, and the Holy Ghoſt of glory, both in giving the earneſt of it, and then working us to the conſummation of it; ſo that God is to be conſidered abſolutely in eſſence and unity; relatively in ſubſiſtence and coeſſentiality.</p>
                  <p>In conſideration of which ſubſiſtency, I conceive that the world; by theſe divine perſons was contrived, the being, preſerving, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlating of nature; which nature conſiſted of intellectuall creatures, as Angels, and of rationall creatures as men, and of bruits, as the ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; of vegetatives as plants, and of other entities and realities that have neither of the former faculties.</p>
                  <p>Now thoſe things that wanted thoſe faculties of Will and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they needed nothing but his providence to preſerve them in being, or to change them as they waxed old. But as he determined to make natures intellectuall and rationall, conſiſting of will and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, ſo he determined, that either he muſt be made abſolute to ſtand by their own innate power, which none can do but the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or elſe they muſt be forcibly ſupported by his power, to ſtand againſt the naturall liberty of their will; and this had been to ſtand
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:37858:30"/>whether they would or no, which had not been an eſtate competible to an intellectuall, rationall, and voluntary ſervice, requiſite to ſuch a creature.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the moſt wiſe God intended before the world to make Angels and men,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Bern.</hi> Non in tuto, ſed in cauto.</note> not in a ſecure but cautionary eſtate, not in abſolute ſtedfaſt glory, but in deſignation to it, <hi>i.</hi> conditionally they kept their created eſtate; but foreſeeing that this cautionary eſtate muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily depend upon the freewill of that creature, and that freewill would ſway them to depend on themſelves, or ſomewhat elſe beſide the Creator for happineſſe, he conſults how ſome of them at leaſt might be ſaved to glorifie him, and be glorified of him.</p>
                  <p>This conſultation was concluded by the eternall Son of God, by an eternall covenant with the Father,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.20.</note> that thoſe intellectuall and ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall creatures, which ſhall depend upon his grace and favour, ſhall be preſerved in their eſtates, as they were created, or elſe redeemed if they fall from it. This ſtipulation is accepted of the Father, and he is ſet as <hi>the firſt born of every creature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.15.</note> not that he was firſt created himſelfe, as <hi>Arrius</hi> thought, but ſet ſo in regard of excellence of pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority by eternall generation,<note place="margin">Coloſ. 1.16.</note> and of ſuperiority, the whole family of heaven and earth depending upon him for creation, and the creature intellectuall and rationall for adoption. So <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. he is called <hi>the firſt born among many brethren.</hi> Now the Covenant being made, and the whole family of heaven being created by him and for him, he is firſt propoſed to the Angels for their worſhip and dependency. <hi>Luci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer</hi> and his complices and faction,<note place="margin">Heb. 1.6.</note> liked independency better, and choſe rather to ſtand by their own created perfection. From whence aroſe the battell of <hi>Michael</hi> and his Angels,<note place="margin">Revel.</note> againſt the Dragon and his Angels, which St <hi>John</hi> ſaw had been, and would be to the end of the world, in a myſticall ſenſe, and that in time he ſhould be caſt out of the heaven of the Church, as he was once out of the heaven of the bleſſed.

                  <p n="1">1. Predeſtination and election are much of one likeneſſe; only election argueth, that God chuſeth one and not another, and predeſtination argueth, that God ordains ſome to glory, and paſſeth by others, though all taken out of the ſame nature and lump; and though both theſe are in the divine mind at once, yet election relates more to perſon, and predeſtination more to the means, by which thoſe perſons ſhould be made happy: For predeſtination is a decree of God,<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note> cauſing in time ſuch effectuall grace in thoſe that are elected, that it will infallibly bring them to glory; and therefore it is ſaid, that the elect are not to be ſeduced, for it is Gods pleaſure to give them the Kingdome, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.32. who hath choſen them in Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the world, that they ſhould be unblameable before him.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You muſt know that predeſtination looks upon all men in the ſame condition; as Iſraels father was an <hi>Amorite,</hi> and their mother an <hi>Hittite,</hi> even of thoſe Nations whom God caſt out of <hi>Canaan:</hi> But that in predeſtination there is ſuch grace prepared, that makes the elect become both holy and happy.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. You are to conceive nevertheleſſe, that this grace prepared for the elect, doth not impoſe any neceſſity, or violent conſtraint upon their wils,<note place="margin">Abul. <hi>in</hi> 3. <hi>Reg. c.</hi> 12. Cant. 1.4. Aug. <hi>de lib. arbit.</hi>

God deſtinates none to ſin, but to puniſhment for ſin; and therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination is not in Scripture applied to the reprobate, becauſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination in Gods is of the means, <hi>i.</hi> grace, and the end, <hi>i.</hi> glory: But reprobation is of the end, <hi>i.</hi> puniſhment, not of the means, <hi>i.</hi> ſin; for predeſtination doth direct a man to that, which by nature he cannot attain; but reprobation deſtinates no man to aim at ſin, to which na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it ſelfe is too prone (when God paſſeth by it in his election) but only preordains men to puniſhment deſerved by ſin: So that as predeſtination neceſſitates no man to good works, ſo Gods not prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinating
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:37858:31"/>ſome, doth not neceſſitate anothers will to evill works, no more then a Kings chuſing one for his favorite, doth neceſſitate him to do vertuous actions againſt his will, nor another to be traiterous with his will: For the decrees of God takes not away the liberty of mans will.</p>

                  <p>Wicked men are not damned becauſe they are not predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, but becauſe they live and die in ſin: For rejection in God, is only a deniall of election, which may ſtand with a poſſibility of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voiding ſin and damnation: So all men in <hi>Adam</hi> were not elected, yet all men in <hi>Adam</hi> had a certain power to ſtand; ſo that as prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtination is not a bare ordination of a man to eternall life, by ſuch a ſufficient means as makes the event poſſible, but it provides to make the means efficacious: So reprobation excludes no man not elected from all means of ſalvation neceſarily, but permits them to be lead by their own will; ſo that predeſtination of ſome,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> doth not damn others by neceſſity of conſequence, but in the infallibility of Gods preſcience; as <hi>Joſeph</hi> did foreſee the ſeven years famine, but did not cauſe it.</p>

                  <p>Nothing can be ſaid to this, but only Gods ſecret will and wiſedome. For men cannot be elected out of any foreſeen vertue, for an eternall cauſe cannot depend upon an externall or temporall effect cauſed thereby, but upon the eternall counſell of Gods moſt free will and favour. So rejection is not moved in God by the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of mans ſin, though his puniſhment be determined thereupon, otherwiſe God may reprobate all as well as ſome, becauſe he foreſaw all would ſin.</p>
                  <p>Therefore theſe operations depend upon Gods ſecret will. It is not in him that willeth, nor in him that runneth,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.16.</note> but in God that ſheweth mercy; for neither predeſtination is not in the power of the elected, nor reprobation in the power of the rejected, but in the will and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, who is the potter, and we clay, he is our father, and we his children, and we ought not under pain of curſing, ſay to our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what haſt thou begot.</p>
                  <p>Therefore God in his electing of us, muſt be underſtood to do it either before mans fall (which the Scripture beſt approveth, calling us elect before the world) or elſe after mans fall by the firſt offence. Now in what eſtate of Man ſoever God did it, he looks upon all men all alike, and ſo no reaſon can be given why he ſhould elect one and reject another: For if he looked upon man in his nocency,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Calv.</hi> Inſtit. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>22.</hi>
                     </note> we can find no reaſon of predeſtination; if in his innocency, we can find no reaſon of reprobation; therefore it is beſt to ſit down with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at the unſearchable wiſedome of God, as St <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.32. and to reſt content with Gods will, as Chriſt doth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.25. And no man can be reprobated, that doth ſo, except he neglect Gods re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation,
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:37858:32"/>or his own duty in purifying himſelfe,<note place="margin">1 John 3.3.</note> as God is holy that hath called him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.9.</p>

But in reprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or rejection of men, God neither deſtinates them to ſin, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents them of grace, nor gives any influx of evill into the ſoul, but leaves men to themſelves: So that the predeſtinate are like the aire warmed and enlightned with the Sun; the Reprobate like the aire left to it own coldneſſe and darkneſſe without the Sun.</p>

                     <hi>But methinks this doctrine of predeſtination leads men into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, becauſe if predestinated, they ſhall be ſaved however they live; and reprobation leads to deſpair, becauſe how well ſoever they live, they are damned.</hi>

                  <p>Though predeſtination be the free grace of God, yet it leaves not men to live as they liſt, but rather leads them to make it as ſure to themſelves by a good life, as it is a ſure foundation in God; <hi>for whomſoever he predeſtinates, he ſanctifieth them, Rom.</hi> 8. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there is a conditionate decree joined with the promiſe of ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>i.</hi> if we repent and beleeve, we ſhall certainly be ſaved: ſo that we may more ſafely ſay, that thoſe that live licentiouſly and repent not, are not elected; for men predeſtinate lay hold upon the abſolute de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree by the conditionate; and yet they know that this conditionate decree may be publiſhed to all, and yet no man ſaved by it; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe a conſcionable performing the condition, is a ſign of election, they will not neglect it; nor doth rejection of it ſelfe leave men in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpaire, ſaving in their own ill grounded opinion. Therefore</p>
                  <p n="1">1. You muſt conceive that there is no abſolute decree caſting off men from all grace which may poſſibly lead them to happineſſe: As the Angels not elected had grace poſſible to ſtand. <hi>Adam</hi> was not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to ſtand, yet he had grace poſſible to ſtand.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. You are to judge, that by this decree of reprobation, is no cauſe of mans ſin; for he only permitteth what he is not bound to hinder. God foreſees evill will be done, but he cauſeth none, only he prevents it not, he commands the contrary, he threatens it with puniſhment; neither of theſe is a cauſe of ſin, no more then not giving an alms to every begger, cauſeth him to ſteal; or a law againſt ſtealing makes men theeves.</p>
                  <p n="3">3.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> de praed. Fulgentius. Calvin.</note> Know that God denying election to ſome men, doth not there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore damn them for his pleaſure, but as he permits them to ſin, ſo he reſolves to puniſh them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Conſider that this deniall of election to ſome, doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce any ſinfull actions as ſinfull; for though the naturall act of ſin
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:37858:32"/>(as it is a reall being) muſt needs flow from him, in whom all things have being, but the obliquity of mans will which cleaveth to the action, is not of God, nor cauſed by his decree of non-election, but of permiſſion.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Nor doth God by this decree of reprobation, over-power the will of ſuch a man, though no doubt he that made the will can over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule it; but leaves it to its own deficiency, by not creating the heart anew, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. For he that beleeves not the word, it is not cauſed by Gods conſtitution in not electing a man, but by mans procliveneſſe to infidelity.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing this work is ſecret and internall in God, we muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaying; <hi>ſecret things belong to God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 29.29.</note> and revealed things to us. And therefore let us alwaies look to Gods revealed will, which inſures us ſalvation upon faith and repentance, and by theſe try their eſtate, and find their election by the effects thereof;<note place="margin">à poſteriore.</note> and be content to know God (as <hi>Moſes</hi>) by his back parts, as the Father by the Son, and the Sons redemption by the ſpirit, that he hath given us.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Be not too eager to know by ſome other way, and thy aſſurance of ſalvation by ſome extraordinary revelation, leſt you fall into ſome dangerous temptation: As 1. To deſpair if you find it not. 2. highly to preſume if you find it. 3. Or elſe ſullenly to neglect all good works till you have found it, but live holily,<note place="margin">Pſal. 50. ult.</note> and truſt God to ſhew it you in his time. Muſt we not all live by faith and hope, in this world? yet if we could have the certainty of election, we ſhall think faith and hope needleſſe. We are ſaved by hope, but hope ſeen is no hope, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.24. Be content with adherence and cleaving to, and holding faſt by him: This is a certain ſigne of election;<note place="margin">Pſal. 42.11.</note> and for aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, leave it to God to give it thee as a comfort and crown of all thy labors, as he did to <hi>Henoch</hi> before he was tranſlated.<note place="margin">Heb. 11.5.</note> So when thou haſt endured the ſtaggerings of <hi>David,</hi> the ſufferings of <hi>Job,</hi> and the buffetings of <hi>Paul,</hi> then God will tell thee his grace is ſufficient for thee. Let others boaſt they have it, do thou uſe all diligence for it, and let patience have its perfect work,<note place="margin">James.</note> that when you have done all, you may find it at laſt.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Do not diſpute with God why he would not elect theſe but thoſe, but reſt in St <hi>Pauls</hi> rule,<note place="margin">Proſp. <hi>de vocal.</hi> Rom. 9.</note> that God was willing this way to reveal his goodneſſe and juſtice. If God hath ordained any to life, it was graciouſly; if any to puniſhment, it was judicially, and what you cannot comprehend, do not reprehend, leſt God reprove thee, as <hi>Job</hi> 38.2. But know God is juſt in all his waies, and holy in all his workes.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Labour to anſwer the temptations that ariſe from predeſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and reprobation. 1. From predeſtination; as thus: I am ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, then I may live diſſolutely, and deſpiſe ordinances, as being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove them. Not ſo; for God did inſure <hi>Ezekiah</hi> fifteen years of life, will he therefore not eat, or be careleſſe of himſelfe? God forbid. So neither muſt we; for then election is not a decree abſolute, but diſſolute. 2. From the conceit of thy reprobation, thou ſhalt be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>betted in that conceit, thus. It is true, thou art called, but many are
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:37858:33"/>called which were never choſen, thou canſt not prove thy ſelfe to be one of the few; yes, if I come in at the call; for I dare not think that God will deceive me, by inviting me to bread, and giving me a ſtone; or giving me a ſtomack and means to ſtarve me. Beſide, I am bound upon my allegiance to God, to beleeve that if he hath cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led me, then he hath elected me till for my offending him, or to try me he withdrawes the comfort thereof from me, by making me to ſuſpect my ſelfe, by examining me how I came in, not having on a wedding garment.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Another temptation may ariſe in thy heart, ſaying; God by his revealed will would have all men to be ſaved, but by his concea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led will many are reprobated. Now conſider therefore God hath not two wils, but in his word he expreſſeth his well wiſhing to all, that they may be ſaved; but foreſeeing they will not all be ſaved, he po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively determines that all ſhall not be damned, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolveth to give the Antidote of his ſaving grace to ſome, without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting any of ſufficient means to be ſaved, though he give them not the ſame efficacy to the means, to draw them to faith and repentance, as he doth to the elect.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Another temptation to know thee deſperate, is this: That though God offers the means of faith and repentance, yet he inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth that the major part of men ſhall not beleeve nor repent: In this caſe bid Satan avoid; for I have not to do with Gods ſecrets; I am content to believe, that he would have me do what he bids me do; and therefore (come of it what will) I will truſt God, and exerciſe my ſelfe to keep a conſcience void of offence, toward God and man; and ſo in well doing I will commit my ſelfe to him as to a faithfull Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and hope to find my name at laſt in this book of Gods ſecret in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall operation, through Jeſus Chriſt whom he hoth ſent.</p>

Beſide, we ſee that he hath alwaies kept up the ſame ſin among men, by making men to ſet up Idolatry; ſome to aſpire to be worſhipped, and called <hi>Elohim,</hi> or Lords; ſome to debaſe God to the image of creatures,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.26. <hi>vid.</hi> R.

And this argueth his firſt ſin to be rebellion againſt the truth determined, to be in due time manifeſted to the world. Indeed Chriſt ſaith he did not abide in the truth, nor indeed could abide it. He did not abide in God who is truth it ſelfe, nor in true obedience in which he was crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, nor in the truth determined concerning Chriſt to be mans Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And indeed this ſeems to be truth from which he fell, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, 1. Becauſe Chriſt cals this Truth, by way of eminence before <hi>Pilate,</hi> ſaying, I am come to witneſſe the truth, <hi>i.</hi> of Gods purpoſe and promiſe. And he cals the Jewes the children of the Devill, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they went about to deſtroy him, and <hi>Judas</hi> a devill, becauſe he fell from him who was the Truth: And becauſe both refuſed to ſtand by his grace and favour, as the Devill alſo did, who hath ever been an oppoſer of this truth from the beginning, as by preventing <hi>Adam</hi> of the ſacramentall ſhadow of the tree of life; and <hi>Cain</hi> of the comfort of true ſacrifice, both which were types of Chriſt: And ſince that he

And thus like the devill, they love not that truth which was the actuall fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of all the types, law, prophecies and promiſes, in which regard it is ſaid,<note place="margin">John 1.</note> that Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. And I think the rather this was the main ſin, becauſe neither he nor <hi>Judas</hi> never repented of it, whom Chriſt called a devill; for it is a ſin cannot be repented of, becauſe committed directly againſt the method of God, Chriſt, and the Spirit of grace, which is the only cauſe and means to true repentance.

They know not God with any comfort, nor know his intentions, nor his determinations, whom he means to ſave or condemn; for then it were in vain to tempt the one, and needleſſe to tempt the other. Nor 2. Have they any certain knowledge of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture events, but make collections either from the ſtars or prophecies of Scripture, or from mens temper, or their actions and endeavors; and therefore their anſwers in Oracles were dark and doubtfull; as when he told the Pope he ſhould die at <hi>Bethelem,</hi>

This conſtitution continued not above ſeven years. But the contention between the Latin and Greek Churches about it laſted 200. years. Then about the time of <hi>Juſtinian</hi> the Emperor, one <hi>Dionyſius Abbas</hi> drew the Paſchall tables, which were confirmed by the Councill of <hi>Chalcedon,</hi> that none ſhould keep Eaſter but according to the Roman account and ſtatute, but ſhould be accounted an Heretick; and this held till the year 1582. yet they finding that the Equinoctium went back from the 21 of <hi>March,</hi> to the eleventh, the Romans corrected their Calender, and ſo there is ſometimes 28 daies difference between them and us, as 1557. and ſometimes 25. daies, as in the year 1565. So they reformed their Paſchall tables, and appointed the Feaſt of <hi>Eaſter</hi> (according to the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> in <hi>Pontus,</hi> 322.) to be celebrated the Sunday after the firſt full moon that ſhould happen after the Sun entred <hi>Aries,</hi> we ſee ſtill difference between us and them, but yet all conclude it on the Lords day.

                  <p>Surely as <hi>Adams</hi> body was more excellent then other mens, being Gods immediate worke; ſo no doubt our bodies are more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent then the common creature. <hi>Adams</hi> body was ſo, becauſe it had in it potentially all the rare qualities which are diſperſed now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many; as the beauty of <hi>Abſalom,</hi> the ſwiftneſſe of <hi>Aſahel,</hi> the proportion of <hi>Eliab</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe:</hi> So that his body exceeded o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers no doubt, as much as Gods tables exceeded <hi>Moſes</hi> workman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and as Chriſts miraculous wine exceeded the naturall, at the wedding. But yet mens are exceeding the creatures in poſture, ſhape, and compact, and in being, an epitome of the whole world.

Laſtly, becauſe it pleaſeth God to make it his Temple; and alſo Chriſt to take it into the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, an honour not vouchſafed to Angels.

                  <p>Every part is conſiderable, but Gods wiſdome is admirable in all, as in making ſome members radicall, and ſome officiall in great variety, and yet in ſympathy one with another. The radicall is the Liver for the naturall ſpirits, the Heart for the vitall, and the Brain for the animall. The officiall members are inward or outward; the inward as the Veins to convey the naturall ſpirits, the Arteries to convey the vitall, and the Sinews to convey the animall ſpirits. The outward are the eie, ear, hand and foot, all which work for the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as well as the mouth eats, and ſtomack digeſts for the good of the body: And for all they be divers, yet are they ſympatheticall and helpers one of another. For as one feels, the other grievs or joies; ſo do they one aſſiſt and ſupply in the defect of another; as the blind mans eies are in his fingers, and the deafe mans eares are in his eies, yet none can ſay to the other, I have no need of thee. This teacheth both ſympathy and unity in the body politick and myſticall, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der too, not to intrude one upon anothers office, but to ſupply and help as need requireth.</p>

                  <p>When I conſider the head, I look upon it as a moſt excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent part, becauſe God hath placed all the ſences there, and but one ſence all the body over beſide, and that is feeling. 2. That it is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-eminent in office, as place, and directeth the whole body, and is the moſt honourable part, and therefore we uncover it when we give honour and worſhip to any, as our reaſon doth lead us; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the name (Head) is given to that which is eminent and chiefe, as <hi>Deut.</hi> 28.24. <hi>thou ſhalt be the head,</hi> and <hi>Pſal.

                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.23. 1 Cor. 11.23.</note> So Chriſt is the head of the Church, the man is the head of the wife, and the head of Chriſt is God. So the eies though two for ornament, and for the help of each other in caſe one ſhould be deficient, yet they look both but upon one object at once, becauſe both the optick nerves meet in one, to teach us when we lift up our eies to God, to be intentive upon him only, and not give him a ſquint-eied devotion. It hath a guard of five tunicles, beſide the brow, and ſo ſets forth the care of God to his children, whom he kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth as carefully as one would the apple of his eie. Before the fall it let in no evill, but now it is ſins broker, an evill eie by envy, an adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous eie by luſt, a covetous eie by deſiring; yet it is not the cauſe of ſin, but the occaſion, and ſo contracts to the inward eie many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes; as the murderer may be ſaid to have a bloodſhot eie, and the luſtfull a pearl in his. The ear is the ſenſe of diſcipline, and the gate
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:37858:39"/>of faith, which comes by hearing. Before the fall it was the gate of life,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 15.</note> now the portall of death, by letting in evill words to corrupt good manners. The tongue is called mans glory, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.9. becauſe by the good uſe of it, we bring honour to our ſelves, and glory to God. It is made ſingle, to teach us that we ſhould not be double-tongu'd. It was once like the pen of a ready ſcribe,<note place="margin">Jam. 3.6.</note> to ſet forth the praiſe of God; but now a world of iniquity, <hi>James</hi> 3.6. It is like a dung-fork, caſts abroad mire and dirt. It is forked in a tripple manner, like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents tongues when they be angry, and kils three at once, the ſlande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, the hearer, and the reporter. So the hand is a moſt rare inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that guideth all others. The tongue of the dumb, who ſpeaks by ſigns. It is the counting table of the ancients, and is yet in uſe in many Countries. Of old they uſed to account on the left, till they were 100. years old, and then on the right, becauſe they were in the years of wiſdome, in whoſe right hand are length of daies, <hi>Prov.</hi> 3. It hath been the inſtrument of divine worſhip, in oaths or vowes, <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.22. I have lift up my hand to the high God. So the heathens wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the ſtars, was, when they kiſſed their hand, which <hi>Job</hi> renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth,<note place="margin">Oſe. 13.2.</note> 
                     <hi>Job</hi> 31.27. Laſtly, it is the inſtrument that feedeth the mouth, or elſe we ſhould feed like beaſts, yet the ſloathfull man will not bring his hand to his mouth, <hi>i.</hi> not uſe this excellent inſtrument to get his living. So the foot is an inſtrument of ſupportation, to uphold and carry the body, and anſwereth to the affections which are as feet to the ſoul; <hi>my foot ſtandeth right ſaith David, Pſal.</hi> And <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> bids us to look to the foot when we enter into Gods houſe, that is, to the mind and affections.

So <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> ſaith, the wiſe man conſidereth his ſteps,<note place="margin">Pro.</note> for the way of the wiſe is above, to keep him from hell beneath, becauſe as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 116. he walketh before God in the light of the living, that every part of a man may be a document, as well as an uſefull ornament, if it be well conſidered of. But the breaſts of a woman are more conſiderable then mans, becauſe it is the veſſel of nouriſhment to a child; placed neer the Liver for the better concoction of the milk; and neer the heart, to excite the mothers affection the more to the child, and childs affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction the more to the mother, whom ſhe may juſtly adjure upon juſt occaſion, by the paps which they have ſucked, when ſhe ſo lovingly embraced them, which no bruit can do.</p>

So the ribs ſhew the care of God to defend the vitall parts, comprized in the heart and the liver; well ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Scripture by <hi>Abner</hi> his ſmiting <hi>Aſahel</hi> under the fifth rib, and <hi>Ioabs</hi> ſmiting him, and alſo <hi>Amaſa,</hi> in the ſame place; and by the ſouldiers piercing Chriſt there about that rib where hangs the <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cardia,</hi> out of which iſſued water and blood, to all which pectorals,<note place="margin">

<pb n="58" facs="tcp:37858:40" rendition="simple:additions"/>we add the breaſt-plate of righteouſneſſe, the ſpirituall heart will be the ſafer.

We find the proverb too true; the propereſt man at the gallowes, and the faireſt woman in the ſtewes: So that we may cry out, O moſt excellent ſoul, what a vile lodging haſt thou gotten? The five ſenſes that have their beginning from common ſenſe, which can judge of all objects abſent, as the five do of the object preſent, are all worthy our conſideration, as to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold how every organ of ſenſe hath his proper object; the Eie, colors, the Ear, ſounds, the Tongue, meats, pleaſant, or not pleaſant; the Noſe, odours, or evill ſavours, the Nerves are eſpecially the ſeat of feeling, as well as the means of motion, and therefore they being in every part, the ſenſe of feeling is in every part, and the other four are in the head only, and though they be ſo neer in ſeat to each other, yet one inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth not another, nor can do as the other. Theſe ſince mans fall are become brokers, to ſet our hearts to ſale to the devill, and the world, for the price of a few momentany delights, and ſo the precious ſoul would be raviſhed out of Chriſts hands, but the ſpirit of God inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth, and by the word of God inſureth us of the interpellation of the Son of God, by which he hath promiſed to marry our ſouls to himſelfe in righteouſneſs and everlaſting glory. So the heart of man is the ſeat of paſſions, a choice veſſell that is firſt formed in generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and firſt reformed in ſpirituall regeneration. And as it firſt lives, ſo it dieth laſt. So the life of grace firſt begins there, and is laſt left there. This is that which God ſtrives for againſt the devill, the world, and the fleſh, as <hi>Michael</hi> did with the devill for <hi>Moſes</hi> body, <hi>Iude</hi> 9. But when we anſwer Gods requeſt, who crieth to us, <hi>Myſon give me thy heart,</hi> then the battell. ceaſeth.

But ſince the fal that man ſet up Idols in his heart, God hath tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it as <hi>Iehu</hi> did the houſe of <hi>Baal,</hi> into a draught houſe, ſo that now as it is full of all uncleanneſſe, ſo out of it proceeds by nature nothing elſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.

                  <p>Not eſſentially, for ſo only God is immortall; nor by the gift of creation, as the Angels and the ſouls of men are, but potenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally only, and upon condition if he had continued in obedience, which he not doing, his body cannot be made immortall now, but by the gift of a new creation, which will be at the reſurrection. So that his body was immortall naturally, ſo long as he kept the condition of immortality. It is true, his body might have died before the fall, for it was as poſſible to die, as he was poſſible to fall. But this poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty would never have been reduced into act, if he had not fallen: For as the Angels could not die, neither was it neceſſary they ſhould die; ſo <hi>Adam</hi> might have died, but it was not neceſſary that without ſin he ſhould have died, ſo being corrupted by ſin, it was neceſſary he ſhould die; but not before he fell: For we ſee by the reliques of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality left in <hi>Adam,</hi> that the Fathers before the flood lived a mighty great age; as <hi>Adam</hi> to 930, years, and <hi>Methuſelah</hi> lived 969. which was not ſo many moons as ſome think; for then they had hardly reached the age of man, and ſo the world would have been a long time peopling; and though <hi>Adam</hi> might well beget <hi>Sheth</hi> about twelve years after his creation, becauſe he was made at firſt a perfect man, yet if <hi>Adam</hi> begat not his third ſon till he was 130. moons old, ſurely then <hi>Sheth</hi> began too young, who at 105. years from his birth, begate <hi>Enos,</hi> which by the moons account was but eight years and five months.

                  <p>Yea, and it may be proved-firſt, from the oppoſition that is between the life of a beaſt, and a man. A beaſts life periſheth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it ends in the ſenſitive facultie, whoſe organs being deſtroied, their life is at an end; for they cannot work beyond the ſenſitive fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, becauſe they want reaſon and underſtanding, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.9. <hi>Be not like the horſe that hath no underſtanding or reaſon;</hi> and you may ſee they have none, becauſe all creatures of the ſame kind, work alike in all they do, as the ſwallowes build all alike, and the ſpiders weave all alike, and beyond it they cannot proceed; but mans operation is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers one from another. Beſide, the deſires of the creature is not to any eternity, but to the preſent preſervation of it ſelfe and it kind; but mans deſires reach higher. So the delight of a beaſt is meerly in things ſenſuall, and therefore it acteth only by the body, becauſe life is ſetled only in the blood, <hi>Levit.</hi> 17.11. but man can delight in things beyond all ſenſe naturall, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8. as to beleeve in Chriſt whom they

                  <p>God having an immediate act in the ſouls production, though by propagation it cannot be diſſolved but by that power who gave it firſt a beginning. Now though he for ſin diſſolveth the body (which conſiſteth of naturall principles) for a while, till he reunites it again to the ſoule at the reſurrection, in a greater perfection, yet we read not that he doth ſo to the ſouls, but they live to him who is not the God of the dead, but of the living ſouls, which cannot die, though congenerated with the body, through Gods powerfull efficacy, the parents mediating the union. And therefore as it is a ſpirituall being, it may very well exiſt after ſeparation from the body, and live, and underſtand, though not as it did in the body by converſion of it ſelfe to the phantaſie, which then it hath not; nor by any formerly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſpecies kept in memory; for then the ſouls of children departed ſhould underſtand nothing; but the ſoule ſeparated underſtandeth as Angels do know a new thing preſented to them.

So Chriſt had no father as man, nor mother as he was God; yet the Council did rightly ſtile the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> the mother of God; that is, of the hypoſtaticall union, not of his eternall generation; ſhe was the medium of uniting the manhood and Godhead together, but no beginning of his ſubſiſting in the Godhead, which never had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of daies, nor can have end of Being. Yet who was this <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedecks</hi> father, is hard to ſay.

In which regard St <hi>Paul</hi> cals him our peace, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.14. and our righteouſneſſe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.30. So that as in his generation, ſo in his name he ſhadowed Chriſt alſo: For as <hi>Melchiſedecks</hi> parents were unknown to that time, ſo were Chriſts in his time; for few beleeved his father was God, or that his mother was a virgin. And as <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> ſeemed to be without beginning, or end of daies, in reſpect of any expreſſe account given of it: So Chriſt had no beginning in his divine nature, nor no end of his Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atorſhip; for his Godhead and his manhood making one perſon, never to be diſſolved, he is a Mediator without end, yea, he lived while his body was dead in the grave, which he raiſed again by the eternall ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And thus what was ſpoken of <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> reſpectively, was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Chriſt ſimply and fully. So <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> was called King of righteouſneſſe and peace, in regard. 1.

He was a Nazarite of <hi>Nazar,</hi> becauſe he was ſeparated from common things, as the Razor and Wine, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.3, 4, 5. So Chriſt was, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. ſeparate from ſinners;<note place="margin">Rom. 12.2.</note> ſo are all in Chriſt ſeparate from the common courſe of the world; for Chriſt was not called a Nazarite from the Town <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he lived, (except by miſtake) but from his calling ceremoniall, to anſwer to <hi>Sampſon</hi> his type. For it is not to be found in the Prophets verbally, that Chriſt ſhould be called a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> but in his perſonall type <hi>Sampſon.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Judg. 13.15.</note> And therefore St. <hi>Matthew</hi> rather al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ludes to the common miſtake of the people, that he ſhould be called a man of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> rather then to his ceremoniall office, a <hi>Nazarite,</hi> according to our Engliſh tranſlation; but in the <hi>Syriach</hi> it is <hi>Naiſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,</hi> of <hi>Naiſar,</hi> to obſerve or keep, as indeed the Nazarites did their vow with all ſtrictneſſe. And ſo from the City the place of his dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the people fulfilled a prophecie, unwittingly, as well as <hi>Caia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas;</hi> and the ſouldier that pierced his ſide fulfilled that of <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. Yea <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe cals him in his ſuperſcription, Jeſus that <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarite</hi> in the Greek;<note place="margin">Nazarenus in loco, &amp; in meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, <hi>1.</hi> ſanctue vel mundus quia pecetum non ficit. <hi>Iſid.</hi> Etym. lib. <hi>7.2.</hi>
                     </note> he meaning the City: But the Spirit that gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded him intending the office ceremoniall of Chriſt, of which <hi>Sampſon</hi> was a figure prophetically ſpoken of in the book of <hi>Iudges,</hi> and made good in Chriſt conceived at <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, the Spirit came not upon <hi>Sampſon</hi> till he was a compleat man; ſo Chriſt did not ſhew himſelfe till thirty years of age, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Iohns</hi> Baptiſm. <hi>Sampſons</hi> firſt victory was over a Lyon; ſo Chriſts over Satan that roaring Lyon,<note place="margin">Mat. 4. <hi>Vid.</hi> Aug <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 70.</note> that ſeeks whom to devour, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.8. Then next he overcomes the Philiſtins. Firſt with the Jaw bone of an Aſſe; So Chriſt by the deſpiſed ſimplicity of preaching, overcame
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:37858:45"/>the world, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.18, 21. though the Preachers of it are derided and ridden of the world for it like Aſſes. Secondly, he riſing from ſleep, carried away the gates of <hi>Azza</hi> upon his ſhoulders. So did Chriſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the grave carry away the gates of hell and death, and lead captivity captive. Thirdly, he was taken in <hi>Dalilahs</hi> lap; ſo was Chriſt in the bonds of poverty and weakneſſe, as the name <hi>Dalilah</hi> ſignifieth. <hi>Sampſons</hi> lock was cut off, and his ſtrength decaied: But Chriſt herein exceeded; for he laied down his ſtrength willingly, by which he made the ſouldiers before fall backward, <hi>John</hi> 18.6. and this out of love to his Church, though an adultereſſe. <hi>Sampſon</hi> was flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, Chriſt was mocked. But at laſt <hi>Sampſon</hi> at his death pulled down the houſe of <hi>Dagon</hi> upon their heads,<note place="margin">Judg. 17.30.</note> and ſo ſlew more at his death then in all his life; and ſo did Chriſt when he cried it is finiſhed on the croſſe, and bowed his head, then was ſin, death and hell quelled at once, though not triumphed over till his reſurrection.</p>
                  <p>The next type was <hi>Iehoſhuah</hi> the High Prieſt to <hi>Iudah,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iehoſhuah.</note> after their return from <hi>Babylon,</hi> at the rebuilding of the Temple, <hi>Zach.</hi> 3.1. He is likened to a branch, and a ſtone, <hi>verſe</hi> 8, 9, 10. and Chriſt is called the branch, <hi>ver.</hi> 8. and a ſtone laied before <hi>Jehoſhuah;</hi> ſo is Chriſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſtone laied before the Prieſts, upon which they muſt build the Church. Satan ſtood on the Prieſts right hand, but was reproved; ſo he thought to get the upper hand of Chriſt, but was vanquiſhed. <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoſhuah</hi> was a brand pulled out of the fire; ſo was Chriſt, when he ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the conſuming fire of Gods wrath, ſaying, It is finiſhed. He was clothed in filthy garments; and ſo was Chriſt with our ſins, that knew no ſin in himſelfe.

                  <p>The firſt was the tree of life in Paradiſe, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.9. which was a ſigne and Sacrament of life, and termed of ſome writers,<note place="margin">Ju. <hi>and</hi> Ties mel. <hi>in Annot.</hi> Rabaaus.</note> a viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Sacrament of inviſible wiſdome. This was not forbidden <hi>Adam</hi> to taſte of, for none is excepted but the tree of knowledge, as <hi>Eve</hi> her ſelfe confeſſeth, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.<note place="margin">Lomb. <hi>lib.</hi> 1. <hi>diſt.</hi> 17. Beda <hi>in</hi> Gen.</note> yet there was great difference between the eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this tree, and the reſt; for in this tree was a ſacrament, in the reſt but only an aliment or nouriſhment. And what was this ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall tree a ſign of, but only of Chriſt, who is the true life of them that beleeve; and a tree of life to all that lay hold upon him, <hi>Pro.</hi> 3.18. who is the wiſdome of the Father, and is made wiſedome to us. This is the beſt tree in the Churches garden, which is Gods Paradiſe. And we ſhall find it ſo, if Chriſt be ſo planted in our conſcience, that we forſake him not for that nice and curious knowledge, which is but a cloak for our own evill diſpoſitions and corruptions, as all ſchiſme and hereſie is. By this tree <hi>Adam</hi> was taught that life was Gods free gift before he ſinned; how much more now is it ſince we have ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. And if <hi>Adam</hi> had repreſentative ſacraments, in the ſtate of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency, how much more have we need of exhibitive ſacraments, to convey grace to us in the eſtate of nocency, although the <hi>Swenkfeldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> both old and new, ſay we need neither Sacraments nor preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>The next Sacramentall ſhadow was Sacrifice.<note place="margin">Sacrifice.</note> A thing done by men (by Gods appointment) as being of the more worthy Sex, and firſt created, to ſignifie him that was the firſt born of every creature; and that the chiefe Sacrificer of all our oblations to God our High Prieſt, Jeſus Chriſt. This rule St <hi>Paul</hi> followed,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.34.</note> who forbids a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man to meddle in Church matters, by ſpeaking in the Church, being not the firſt in the creation, though chiefe in tranſgreſſion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. Some think that before the Law, only the oldeſt of the families or Prophets did facrifice. But there is no certainty of Scripture for it, ſince that <hi>Abel</hi> the younger, ſacrificed as well as <hi>Cain</hi> the elder bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.<note place="margin">Gen. 4.3.

                  <p>This word ſacrifice, ſignifieth a thing ſacred or holy, and had di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers names. <hi>Mincha,</hi> a gift or oblation. <hi>Gnolah,</hi> becauſe it aſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, as in fire. <hi>Zebach,</hi> killed, <hi>i.</hi> if it were a thing had life. <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beach,</hi> becauſe laid on the Altar. <hi>Karhan,</hi> drawing neer to God. Now as Chriſt the Son of God, was ſignified by the tree of life; ſo as he was the ſon of man, he was typed by ſacrifice, whether animate or inanimate. For 1. He was the only meritorious oblation. 2. He was laied upon his croſſe, as upon the Altar, in ſimilitude to the Altar of ſacrifices; but he offered himſelfe by the eternall ſpirit, by which he was ſeparate to the work of our redemption. Now that all Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice was but a type of his oblation of himſelfe, it is ſaid that he was the lamb ſlain from the beginning of the world vertually, and ſo Chriſt is, yeſterday and to day, and the ſame for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.8. Virtually for them before he came in the fleſh; Actually when he came in the fleſh, and ſo efficaciouſly for all beleevers paſt, preſent, future; for ſacrifice did not only repreſent him, but did exhibit him to all that in faith did expect him, though veiled, as we beleeve up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him though under the Goſpell revealed. For it is true that God printeth an effectuall operation upon things ſacramentall.<note place="margin">

                  <p>The next ſhadowe of Chriſt ſacramentally,<note place="margin">Paſſeover.</note> is circumciſion, which was firſt commended to <hi>Abraham, Gen.</hi> 17. and to his ſeed till Chriſt came and aboliſhed it, and placed Baptiſme in the room of it, which being once ſetled,<note place="margin">Gal. 5.2.</note> Chriſt profits them nothing who are circumciſed; for baptiſme is the Gentiles circumciſion, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.11, 12. In Chriſt they were circumciſed by the circumciſion made without hands, which is putting off the body of the ſins of the fleſh, by the circumciſion of Chriſt, being buried with him in baptiſme, and raiſed again by faiths operation. By which we ſee what circumciſion was in it ſelfe, even cutting off the foreskin of the male-kind his generative part, and alſo what it ſignified in Chriſt, even the caſting away the ſins of the fleſh.</p>

                  <p>Surely not for his own ſake, but for ours. For by circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion he becomes bound to keep the Law, and ſo became ſurety for us, that he would ſatisfie all for us in reſpect of precept and puniſhment; For whoſoever was circumciſed, was bound to keep the whole Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.3. He underwent it alſo to excuſe or exempt us from that hard Sacrament, and yet to convey us the grace of mortification by a more eaſie Sacrament, even by baptiſme. Alſo that thereby his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe might be conveied effectually to all <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed by nature or grace, that beleeved upon this Chriſt the promiſed ſeed; of whoſe righteouſneſſe,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.11.</note> circumciſion was to them, and baptiſme is the ſeale to us,<note place="margin">Rom. 4.23, 24.</note> to whom the ſame righteouſneſſe ſhall be imputed, if we beleeve in him that raiſed up Chriſt, who as he was circumciſed, was typed forth by circumciſion the ſeale of that righteouſneſſe promiſed to come upon man by the promiſed ſeed, Chriſt. This was the firſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:37858:47"/>ſacrament that God gave to mankind.

It is true, that many other people were circumciſed, but to them it was no ſeal of covenant, but to <hi>Iſaacs</hi> people only of whom it was promiſed, that in <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſhall thy ſeed be called.

                     <note place="margin">Herodotus <hi>in</hi> Euterpe.</note> But if they had it, ſurely, it was taken up from ſome of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> ſcattered proge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, the ſon of <hi>Abraham</hi> by <hi>Hagar;</hi> which circumciſion the Haga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rens, who call themſelves <hi>Saracens,</hi> do practiſe at this day; but it is to them no ſeal except of family only.</p>

                  <p>It was the Paſſeover, called in the originall <hi>Peſach,</hi> a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe the deſtroying Angell paſſed over the houſes of the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites in the plague, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.12. This Paſſeover was a ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall Feaſt appointed of God, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12. In the very term it ſignifieth Chriſt, in whom our ſin was paſt over, and our puniſhment alſo, and both laiod upon himſelfe. This Feaſt was to be kept in the month <hi>Abib,</hi> which God appoints to be their firſt month in the year, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as before they began it in <hi>Tiſri,</hi> about the autumnall equinoctiall. But it muſt now begin in the vernall, to type forth him, from whoſe reign in our heart, we are to begin our time of ſpirituall birth, as the Church did her eccleſiaſticall accompt. The meat of this Feaſt was to be a Lamb, or an He-Goat of a year old; the Lamb typing forth Chriſts innocent nature, the Goat our corrupt nature. So it was to be ſet apart on the tenth day of <hi>Abib,</hi> and ſlain the fourteenth day at evening. So Chriſt came to <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> about that time, as if to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare himſelfe to be that oblation, and preached there,<note place="margin">Rabanus.</note> and was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traied by <hi>Judas,</hi> and taken by the Jewes, and crucified on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day, about the eighth and ninth hour,<note place="margin">

This time both in regard of the month and houre, had a ſpeciall relation to Chriſt. For the name of this month <hi>(Abib)</hi> ſignifieth an ear of corn, not only becauſe in this month the green ears of corn appeared, but alſo becauſe in this month they were to offer the firſt fruits of corn to God, <hi>Lev.</hi> 23.14. the green corn relating to Chriſt, who in this month, was to ſpring up freſh and green out of the earth, by his reſurrection, and to become the firſt fruits of the dead, which by that reſurrection of his ſhould be all rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. This was prophecied of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.16. <hi>There ſhall be an handfull of corn in the earth, upon the top of the mountains, whoſe fruit ſhall bud like Lebanon, and ſhall flouriſh from the City as graſſe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John 12.24.</note> This was effected by Chriſts death upon mount <hi>Calvary,</hi> after which he was ſowed like corn in the ground by his buriall, and after he was thus mortified,
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:37858:48"/>then by his reſurrection he multiplied in the hearts of men, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved upon him to be the fruitfull ſeed of eternall life, and the Sun of excellency, both which the word <hi>Bar</hi> in that Pſalm ſignifieth, as well as in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.12.</p>
                  <p>Their celebration of this feaſt alſo was typicall.<note place="margin">

In daſhing the blood of it on their door-poſts, it ſignified the ſprinkling of Chriſts blood upon the conſcience, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>cap.</hi> 10.22. to purifie it from dead Egyptian works, and to guard our ſouls from the deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Angel. The roſting of this Lamb, typed forth the wrath of God, which Chriſt was to undergo, which made him in the garden ſweat blood like roſted fleſh, and to cry out, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me. So their eating of it in one family, typed out the one true Church united to Chriſt. So the calling of another family to them,<note place="margin">Rabanus.</note> if one were too little, ſhewed the calling in the Gentiles to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of Chriſt, becauſe they without us ſhould not be made perfect, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.40. In that they were to eat all of it, the inward appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as well as the outward parts, it ſhewed that the divinity and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of Chriſt, muſt both by faith be fed upon, and that the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt things of Chriſt, muſt not be rejected, becauſe every part and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell of him in his rudiments, principles, as well as in ſubſtance, is profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to ſalvation. Again, if any thing remained of it, they were to burn it, that ſhewed, that if there were any thing in Chriſt which we could not as yet digeſt,<note place="margin">Rabanus.</note> as in the great myſtery of his Incarnation, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection or Aſcenſion, we ſhould with all ſubmiſſive reverence, commit it to the Holy Ghoſt who in his time and by his divine light ſhall reveale it unto us.</p>
                  <p>This Sacramentall ſervice no doubt did alſo foretype how we in after-times ſhould receive Chriſt in the Sacrament.

But the people gave it the name Mannah, or man, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.15. by ſaying <hi>Manha,</hi> Is it a gift, or this is a gift; for <hi>Man</hi> or <hi>Mannah</hi> ſignifieth a portion, or a gift; and ſo it was indeed to be acknowledged the free gift of God, as Chriſt is, upon which we are to feed by faith in our travell in this wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſſe of ſin, till we come to the land of everlaſting reſt. Therefore
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:37858:48"/>Chriſt cals himſelfe the bread of life, that came down from heaven;<note place="margin">John 6.33, 35.</note> and S. <hi>Paul</hi> cals this manna ſpiritual bread, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.3.

                        <hi>Aug.</hi> de utilit. paenit.</note> and whoſoever did in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na underſtand Chriſt did eat the ſame ſpirituall bread with us, which is better then their manna, ſo far as ſubſtance is beyond a ſhadow. And therefore though called heavenly food becauſe it came down from heaven, yet it muſt give way to him that came from an higher heaven than that did.<note place="margin">

So in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper, the bread ſacramentall is not that which goeth into the body, but the eternall bread which ſuſtaineth the ſubſtance of our ſoule; for the naturall nutriment periſheth, but the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is bread not for the belly, but the bleſſed ſoule. They were to gather it every day, to ſhew that we muſt gather alwaies ſomething of heaven. It began firſt to fall on the firſt day of the week, but none on their ſeventh, to type forth to them, that the true manna would ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear on the firſt day of the week, as indeed he did (as Chronologers do account) in his birth and reſurrection; and ever ſince the heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly manna of his word falleth upon that day, whereon if men neglect to gather it, God may juſtly famiſh them, and deny to them the bread of life.</p>
                  <p>The meaſure for each to gather, was an omer for a day, the tenth part of an ephah, which was the quantity of forty three hens eggs, a competent portion. Therefore God ſo ordered it by his divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, that he that gathered much had nothing over, and he that gathered little had no lack, <hi>Exod.</hi> 16.17.<note place="margin">Rom. 12.3.</note> Now as manna repreſents Chriſt, ſo doth the omer the capacity of every beleever, to whom God hath given a meaſure of faith: For the filling of which meaſure or ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, every beleever muſt be ſtirring betimes, as the Iſraelites did before the ſun of perſecution ariſe, which diſſolves the ſacred cuſtome of Gods ordinances; which if men would do, the little they get ſhould be enough, becauſe God accepts their will for the deed. 2. This manna may ſignifie our temporall eſtates, and the omer the meaſure of getting; and ſo St <hi>Paul</hi> applyeth it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.14, 15. namely, that there ſhould be ſuch an equality, that the abundance of ſome,<note place="margin">Pro. 22.2.</note> the want of others, might be ſupplied, and yet not levelling every mans eſtate in the quantity, but by communicating to others the portions of charity. Thus they did in the primitive times, till thoſe frivolous words of (<hi>Mine</hi> and <hi>Thine</hi>) came in,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Chryſ.</hi> in Hom. oportet ſis re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes eſſe.</note> which hath vexed the world with ſo much wranglings, whereas before men lived like Angels, now like devils.</p>
                  <p>Again, whereas in the ſixth day they were to gather double ſo much, it figured that in the ſixt age of the world, which now is, the gifts of God, ſhould be doubled; and alſo that in our latter age, we ſhould labour the more for Gods grace, becauſe our ſabbath of reſt draweth neerer to us. And farther, in that God made that to ſtink which was gathered over and above, either out of diſtruſt that they ſhould not find it the next day, or out of ſloath to ſave their labour in going out. We 1. Ought not to diſtruſt the ſufficiency of Chriſt, who

                  <p>Firſt, we find <hi>Noah's</hi> name to ſignifie a Comforter; ſo was Chriſt to be, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61. Secondly, a Comforter to them that mourn; his office was to preach righteouſneſſe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. that is, of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe of Gods judgement in drowning the world for ſin, and the righteous grace of God in ſaving ſome. Again,<note place="margin">Anſelm. <hi>in</hi> Rom. 14.</note> the righteouſneſſe of man in a civill ſenſe, and morall behaviour, which cannot ſave him from Gods wrath, and the righteouſneſſe of man by faith, which lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hold of the ark of Gods ſalvation. And as he was a preacher, ſo he was a builder, <hi>i.</hi> of an ark, by both which he endeavoured to edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the old world, and make it Gods Church, but they would not, and ſo he built an ark as a type of it only wherein he ſaved himſelfe and his houſhold, only becauſe the ſpirit of Chriſt ſpeaking in him was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by the world. The ark ſignified the Church of the faithfull,<note place="margin">1 Pet.</note> who are like the wood thereof, of a mounting nature, above all the waters of the worlds temptations. So in regard of their juncture, it ſignified that unity by which the Church is combined; the length, breadth, and height, the dimenſions of Chriſts love to the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.14. The door but one, ſignifieth that one entrance into the Church by Baptiſme, as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> The window ſignifieth the light which God gives to his Church, whereby to ſee and contemplate his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments upon the wicked, that die not in the unity of the Church. The three rooms the ſacred Trinity, in whom all things live, move,<note place="margin">Acts 17.28.</note> and have being, but eſpecially the godly who are effectually baptized into thoſe names which are three in one, as the three rooms in one Ark. The divers creatures in the Ark, ſhew the mixture of the Church viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſiſting of reaſonable and unreaſonable, clean and unclean, wheat and tares, good and bad. And in that there were ſeven couples of clean, and but one couple of unclean; it ſhewes that reprobates have little to do in Gods true Church, and though ſome, yet are they no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in compariſon of thoſe that are out of the Church viſible. So <hi>Noah</hi> being Maſter and Lord of all theſe, might well type forth Chriſt, under whoſe feet God hath put all things in ſubjection, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 8.</p>

                  <p>For 1. <hi>Moſes</hi> Tabernacle was a type of the Church Catholick, as it is militant, wandring in this world, and diſcontinuing from the Lord.<note place="margin">Bed. <hi>de tab. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 1.

Both theſe, <hi>viz.</hi> Tabernacle and Temple typed Chriſt. Firſt, the Tabernacle did, becauſe Chriſt is ſaid to dwell or pitch his Taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:37858:50"/>as the Greek word ſignifieth in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.18. ſo did the Temple too,<note place="margin">Beza <hi>in</hi> John 1.18. <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>

                  <p>And as theſe typed out Chriſt, ſo they did the Church, both in the whole body, and the members of it. 1. In the whole, called the houſe of God, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. and <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.3. Now Jeruſalem is called the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle of God, becauſe he meant to dwell with men, by the Goſpel ruling in their hearts, as once he did in the Temple of old Jeruſalem. 2. In the members of it. Therefore <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.21. they are called a Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and <hi>ver.</hi> 22. an habitation of God by the ſpirit, and a Temple of the Holy Ghoſt,<note place="margin">Haymo <hi>in</hi> Rev. 21.</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. whoſe greatneſſe though the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not contain, yet he is content to dwell in a contrite heart. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, if we conſider the place where <hi>Moſes</hi> received the platform of the Tabernacle, it will be more clear. <hi>Moſes</hi> received it in <hi>Horeb,</hi> which ſignifieth a drie deſart, as <hi>Sinai</hi> or <hi>Seneh</hi> a buſh, in which God at firſt appeared to him. The dry deſart ſignified the world, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Law of God is given. The burning buſh the fiery afflictions of the Church in this land of thorns.</p>
                  <p>The man <hi>Moſes</hi> that was faithfull in all the work of the Tabernacle, having received it from God, did well repreſent Chriſt, who received from the boſome of his Father, what things he delivered for the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring up of his Church; and ſo was as <hi>Moſes,</hi> a Mediator between God and his people.<note place="margin">Exod. 35.30, 34.</note> The chiefe workmen typed out the Apoſtles that had their gifts by infuſion, as <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab,</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Dan,</hi> ſignifying praiſe and judgement, and were indeed Arch-buil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10. and ſo to be eſteemed of all men. Thoſe that were ſubordinate to them, might prefigure out inferiour miniſters, of which every one muſt prove faithfull, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. So the people offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, typed forth thoſe in after times under the Goſpell, that ſhould freely give themſelves firſt to God, and then of their goods liberally for the upholding Gods Church and ſervice, ſo often prophecied of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10, 11. and <hi>Iſa.</hi> which was fulfilled by the Eaſtern Magi, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2. and by the Primitive Converts, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. And ſo alſo by the many indowments of the Church given by Princes and others who beleeved the Goſpell.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, the time of ſetting up the Tabernacle and Temple, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to Chriſts comming;<note place="margin">Exod. 24.</note> for as that was ſet up by <hi>Moſes</hi> in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth month, and the Temple by <hi>Solomon</hi> in ſeven years, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 6.37, 38. and in the ſeven ſevens of years, the ſecond Temple was finiſhed. So after ſeventy ſevens of years,<note place="margin">Dan. 9.25.</note> from the Angell <hi>Gabriels</hi> ſpeech to <hi>Daniel,</hi> Chriſt the Meſſiah came from heaven, and took up an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temple of our nature, laied it down by death for our ſins, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed it up again for our juſtification, upon which doctrine he hath built his Church, of which the Jewiſh was but a ſhadow.</p>
                  <p>This may further be underſtood by the triple diviſion of this Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle and Temples rooms, which were three. Fiſt, the Court.

                  <p>Thoſe in the <hi>Sanctum,</hi> or Holy place, were, The Altars, the Laver, the Table for Shew bread, and the Candleſtick. 1. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, which were two; of redemption, which was that on which creatures were offered by fire, and ſignified our redemption effected by the bloodſhedding of Jeſus Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gen. 4.4.

And ſo he is for us by his mediation, making our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion acceptable by the ſweetneſſe of his interceſſion, as <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3. who is the one only Mediator betwixt God and man, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. either for redemption ſignified by the bloody Altar covered with braſſe; or for interceſſion ſignified by the Altar of perfume which was covered with gold, typing that in heaven, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.

                  <p>This table with the bread and frank inſence ſet thereon, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>figured divers things in the New Teſtament.<note place="margin">Orig <hi>in</hi> Lev. 24.</note> The table might the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Scripture, and the bread of propoſition the Miniſters, becauſe the table was never to be removed, but the bread was every ſeventh day,<note place="margin">Bed. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 7.</note> and new ſet on upon the Sabbath. So the Miniſters having finiſhed their courſe, are taken off by death, and others come in their place. But more properly the Table of the Lord, named 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.21. by St <hi>Paul,</hi> and is never called an Altar by the ancient writers, but only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is a ſacramentall ſeale of Chriſts body broken, and his blood ſhed, though the Papiſts love to call it ſo, the more eaſily to make people beleeve that Chriſts very fleſh is there preſent.</p>
                  <p>The bread for number being twelve great cakes;<note place="margin">Tremelius <hi>on the Ephab,</hi> Exod. 16.36.</note> and in reſpect of their order being ſix in a rank, one againſt the other, ſeemeth to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent Chriſts twelve diſciples, whom he ſent out two by two. This order of ſetting them, is found by the Hebrew word, <hi>Grerec,</hi> which ſignifieth the order of martiall ranks. So theſe being preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the Prieſts eating, it ſheweth, 1. Who hath right to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly bread of the Lords Table, even ſuch as are called to be holy Prieſts to God, as none might eat of theſe but the Prieſts only. It is true that <hi>David</hi> and his men did ſo, but it was in caſe of great neceſſity, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in charity diſpenſed with the Law, and in ſome caſes the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on cannot be denied to ſome not prepared, according to the ſtrict or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the Sanctuary; as <hi>Judas</hi> was not, and yet received the holy Supper; yet examples are no rules when they vary from common Law.</p>
                  <p>Alſo it ſheweth, that God will provide for thoſe that ſerve at his

                  <p>The frank incenſe, which with the bread was taken off, and was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to God, ſignified the thankſgiving which we are to offer to God for all his benefits,<note place="margin">

                  <p>This mercy ſeat was ſhadowed by two golden Cherubins with
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:37858:52"/>ſtretched out wings, and from one end to the other; and their faces bending downward as looking into the Ark, as deſirous to behold the great myſtery of mans redemption, ſignified hereby, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.

                     <note place="margin">Exod. 25.22.</note> and we can have no comfortable anſwer, nor apparition of God, but by Chriſt the mercy ſeat.</p>
                  <p>Two other things were ſet by this Ark of Teſtimony or before it, namely, <hi>Aarons</hi> rod that budded, to convince the peoples rebellion againſt him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 16.17.<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.2.</note> This rod might as it was a dry ſtick ſignifie Chriſt, who though he ſeemed as contemptible,<note place="margin">Orig. <hi>in</hi> Ex. <hi>c.</hi> 25.</note> yet brought miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous fruits to mankind, enough to prove, that he was choſen of God, though rejected of men. As alſo the flouriſhing fruit of the Goſpels diſcipline, in the hearts of men by Gods powerfull bleſſing, though the miniſtry ſeems to the world as fooliſhneſſe,<note place="margin">Bed.</note> yet it ſhall prove as the ſcepter of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The reſervation of this rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſhewed, that the miniſtry of Chriſt our High Prieſt, will ever and anon be quarrelled againſt by thoſe who ſhal think themſelves holy enough for the miniſtry, til God ſtop their murmurings by ſome extraordinary work, and ſhall caſt away the rod of their preſumption, as things of no value, as he hath done that of <hi>Rome,</hi> and many other Hereticks and Sectaries, making the true miniſtry of the Goſpell flouriſh above all, as he hath done the Proteſtant Religion in the hearts of people, beyond all the feined miracles of <hi>Rome,</hi> which is the right Epiſtle of recommendation to the truth preached, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.2, 3. Thus <hi>Aarons</hi> rod ſignified Chriſt and Goſpell-miniſtry. Firſt, Chriſt who ſeemed in the promiſe but a dry ſtick, but in the Prophets as this rod bloſſoming; but in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell as this rod bringing forth ripe fruit. Secondly, the Miniſtry of the Goſpell in doctrine and diſcipline. Firſt, in diſcipline, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. ſhall I come to you with a rod. Secondly, in the doctrin, which at firſt worketh on the affections inviſibly, next in the tongue it bloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes by good words, and laſtly, in the life by laudable deeds.</p>
                  <p>As for the pot of manna which was here reſerved, it ſhewed not only how God had fed their fathers in the wilderneſſe, and ſo ſtirred them up to thankfulneſſe, but was as ready to do as much for them if need required.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing there, was the golden Cenſer, <hi>Levit.</hi> 16.12. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.4. This veſſell pertained only to the High Prieſt (all the other were of braſſe, <hi>Num.</hi> 16.39.) and then to be uſed when he entred into the moſt holy, once in a yeare.<note place="margin">Lev. 16.2, 12, 13.</note> This no doubt ſignified the merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious obedience of Chriſt, through which all the praiers of Saints is offered and accepted of God.<note place="margin">Rev. 7.2. Haymo <hi>in</hi> Apoc. v. 1.</note> We find him therefore ſet forth by an Angell comming up from the Eaſt (called alſo the Angell of the Covenant, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.3.) having a golden Cenſer full of odours to offer up with the praiers of all Saints.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:37858:53"/>that one only ſpirit of God, which can only ſet our devotions on a flame.

                  <p>Thoſe that concern Chriſts Nativity, Death and Reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and Aſcenſion. The firſt promiſe of him was in Paradiſe, <hi>The ſeed of the woman ſhall break the Serpents head, i.</hi> his crafts and policies to hinder mans happineſſe. And this Chriſt did by acting contrary to Satan, as ſetting up humility againſt pride, and truth againſt falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood; the one was ſeen in his birth,<note place="margin">Luke 2.7.</note> and the other in his anſwer to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tans temptations, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. For this ſeed of the woman was Chriſt born in the fulneſſe of time, <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.4.

                     </note> and not <hi>Alamoth</hi> a covered virgin. And indeed ſuch an one ſhe muſt be, that he may be of womans ſeed, not mans. Nay more, that he may be a fit Redeemer. For if we ſuppoſe man a ſinner, againſt an infinite God, either he muſt be ſubjected to infinite wrath, or ſatisfie that wrath ſome other way. If a man doubt that he be a ſinner, and ſo deceive himſelfe by conceiving, that ſins are no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but mans properties and inclinations, which beaſts have, and yet ſin not; let him conſider that meer nature will do nothing to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy it ſelfe,<note place="margin">Prov. 1.</note> though depraved nature will. An horſe drinks no more then will do him good, but man will. In vain is the net ſpread in the ſight of any bird; yet men are caught by that they know, and which they wilfully offend. This argueth ſomething of ſin, by which we remain not in the honor of our creation, but became worſe then the beaſts that periſh.</p>
                  <p>Now for this ſin all men muſt ſuffer eternall wrath, except God can be ſatisfied. Now Angels cannot, for they be not of our kind, or if they were, they be ſo many ſeverall perſonalities as there are An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; and as the ſin of one taints not anothers nature, except there be a perſonall conſent; ſo neither can one merit for another, though there be conſent. And for the other creatures irrationall, they cannot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are of leſſe value then mans nature. The blood of buls and of goats and ſheep,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.4, 5.</note> and birds, though ſacrificed, yet that was not to ſatisfie, but to ſhew what man deſerved, and in reference to a more full ſatisfaction to be done in due time: For which cauſe God diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with ſuch ſacrifice for a time,<note place="margin">Heb. 9.22.</note> for mans relative inſtruction, that without bloodſhedding could be no remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Therefore this redemption muſt be made by a man, becauſe that man had offended; ſo in the old law a brother muſt redeem. But he muſt be more then a man too, for no man that is meerly a man, can redeem his brother out of Gods hand of juſtice;<note place="margin">Pſal.</note> ſo then he muſt be one that is equivalent with God, that the ſword of juſtice muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed upon, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. <hi>Awake Oſword againſt him that is my fellow:</hi> Therefore if he muſt be a man, then he muſt not be begotten by the ordinary way of generation, by man and woman; for then he is a ſinner in the firſt conception, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and ſo had need of a Redeemer himſelfe. Nor by a man only, for nature hath denied conception, breeding and bearing to a man. Then he muſt of neceſſity be made of a woman without a man, and then ſhe muſt needs be a virgin; and though this Virgin her ſelfe came of a ſinfull line, yet ſin being but an accident, is left, and the ſubſtance of her was only taken, and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately united to the divine nature, by the power of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo making both natures one perſon, by which he becomes ſo meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous a Redeemer for all mankind.</p>

                  <p>Therefore as his Nativity was prophecied by <hi>Jacob, Gen.</hi> 49.10. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of Shiloh, and fulfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.1. in the daies of <hi>Herod</hi> the King.

And thus as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaid, <hi>cap.</hi> 9.6. <hi>To us a child is born, and to us a Son is given;</hi>

                     <hi>ſo to us he was born, Luke</hi> 2.11. that was wonder by his wiſdome and miracles, the everlaſting Father by his divine eſſence, not ſubſiſtence, and the Prince of peace by his reconciliation of God and man. And this birth of his was not only ſanctified by circumciſion on the eight day,<note place="margin">Luke 1.21.</note> as <hi>Iſaacs</hi> figure was, <hi>Gen.</hi> 21.4. but alſo it was graced by a ſtar, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by <hi>Balaam, Num.</hi> 24.17. and fulfilled, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.9. which conducted the wiſe men out of the Eaſt, to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and then to <hi>Bethelem,</hi> where they worſhipped him, and offered precious things to him, which was foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.12. the rich among the people ſhall do thee homage, and the daughter of <hi>Tyre</hi> ſhall be there with a gift. And Kings ſhall bring preſents to thee, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.29. And the Kings of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Saba</hi> ſhall bring gifts, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 72.10.

After ſixty two weeks ſaid <hi>Daniel,</hi> ſhall Meſſiah be cut off, but not for himſelfe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.25, 26. that is, if you mark the verſes, the Angel allots ſeven weeks for rebuilding of the Temple, which is forty nine years, reckoned of the Jewes but forty ſix years, <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.20. becauſe they reckoned not the firſt three years when the foundation was but laid by <hi>Cyrus</hi> his edict, and the work ſtaied again by <hi>Artaxerxes Longimanus,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ezra 4.7.</note> till they had got a ſecond Edict, <hi>Ezra</hi> 6.1. from <hi>Darius Nothus.</hi> Then the Angell allots to the former ſeven weeks, ſixty two weeks more, which is

                  <p>This ſcourging, wounding, and piercing, was foreſeen alſo by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. he was bruiſed for our iniquities, and chaſtiſed for our peace. And ſaith <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.12. <hi>they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced,</hi> for a ſouldier pierced his ſide, as well as others did his hands and feet when they nailed them to the croſſe. So his very carrying of his croſſe,<note place="margin">John 19.34.</note> was typed out by <hi>Iſaac</hi> carrying the wood to ſacrifice himſelf upon:<note place="margin">Gen. 22.9, 10.</note> And as <hi>Abraham</hi> ſtretched out his hand to ſlay his ſon; ſo God loved the world, that he gave his Son, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. and he himſelf became obedient to the death of the croſſe:<note place="margin">Numb. 21.9.</note> And as <hi>Moſes</hi> lifted up the brazen ſerpent in the wilderneſſe for the curing of the people, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a pole;<note place="margin">John 12.32.

                  <p>So alſo his Reſurrection had a type; as <hi>Iſaac</hi> taken from the Altar, and reſtored ſafe and ſound to <hi>Abraham</hi> the third day after that he was aſſigned to death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.4. of whom it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived him again in a figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> In what figure, but only of him that was to come of his ſeed, in whoſe death and reſurrection all nations ſhould be bleſſed. So <hi>Ionah</hi> the firſt Prophet, who lived in the time of <hi>Ieroboam</hi> the ſecond,<note place="margin">2 Kin. 14.25.</note> and the firſt Prophet ſent to the Gentiles, to <hi>Niniveh,</hi> who becauſe he diverted to <hi>Tarſus,</hi> was ſwallowed of a great fiſh; in whoſe belly he remained till the third day after; and for ſo long time the grave ſwallowed Chriſt, but then he aroſe, and ſo his fleſh ſaw no corruption, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. and that might well be without a miracle, if the body be not accidentally corrupted before it be dead, as in violent deaths, commonly men are not. Now Chriſt lay not in the grave above 40. hours, and commonly dead bodies corrupt not til about ſeventy hours, and this ſheweth that he roſe within three daies, and ſo ſaw no corruption, as the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16. which is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded plainly ſo by St <hi>Peter, Acts</hi> 2.31. And as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> had alſo fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told, that the dead men ſhould live, and with Chriſts body they ſhould come, ſo they did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.52, 53. Thus Chriſt conquered death in his own Kingdome, as ſaid <hi>Hoſea,</hi> 13.14. and death had no more dominion over him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.9. becauſe he was now ſwallowed up into victory, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.55.

                  <p>And for his Aſcenſion, as it was prophecied, ſo it was accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. <hi>Eliah</hi> was a type of it, 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.11. being taken up in a fiery Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot; ſo Chriſt was taken up out of his diſciples ſight into heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.51. as was prophecied in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18.

And now he ſits on Gods right hand foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. and averred in <hi>Mark</hi> 16.19.

And firſt of all I deſire to underſtand rightly his Conception, for therein lieth a great myſtery, wherein our underſtanding is eaſily loſt, if we be not rightly directed. For how can one perſon in the Trinity be concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, or become incarnate without the other two, ſeeing the divine nature is not divided, but is in each perſon totally.</hi>

                  <p>The divine nature cannot be divided for ſubſtance, but in the manner of ſubſiſtence it is diſtinguiſhed. For it is after one man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in the Father, <hi>i.</hi> unbegotten. After another manner in the Son,<note place="margin">

After another manner in the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe proceeding from both, <hi>John</hi> 15.16.

                  <p>He was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt effectually, not mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rially; he cauſed it to be, but gave not any matter out of himſelfe to the nature of Chriſt; ſo that he was conceived by the power of the Holy Ghoſt uniting the natures divine and humane together,<note place="margin">Bernard.

So it is ſaid, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.36. all things are of God, yet not of his ſubſtance, but by his power; ſo that we are to beleeve that he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt, in regard that his humane nature was produced from the bleſſed Virgin by his power, and united to the divine, but aſſumed by the Son, the ſecond perſon, upon the Holy Ghoſts preparation of the Virgins ſeed, and carrying it to the place of conception, which <hi>Luke</hi> 1.42. is called the fruit of her womb, that is, the whole man or humane ſubſtance without the accident of ſin, which followeth only generation, not this wonderfull conception. Therefore our ſin was to him imputed, not by nature imparted, and death therefore ſeized not upon him by neceſſity, but he gave his life voluntarily, and it was taken away vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently by others ſin, not his own.</p>

                  <p>He muſt be conceived on his mothers part, that he might be a man, and ſo fit for a ſurety for us; yet by the Holy Ghoſt, that ſo the ſubſtance might be ſeparated from the accident of originall ſin by his power, who in the moment of conception united it to the ſecond perſon, with whom it made but one perſon, which was no perſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, though it conſiſted of a ſoule and body; and ſo though it came from <hi>Adam,</hi> and was originally in <hi>Adam,</hi> yet it never ſinned in <hi>Adam,</hi> becauſe it took not perſonality from <hi>Adam,</hi> though it did nature; which nature was made ſo holy by this union, that it needed no other ſanctification as other men do, who are to be ſanctified by the blood of the Covenant, through the operation of the Holy Ghoſt; which not being warily obſerved, hath made many hereſies. For the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cionites and Manicheans, not well underſtanding the conception of his manhood, ſuppoſed that Chriſt had an incorporeall body, and only paſſed through the bleſſed Virgins body. And <hi>Apollinaris</hi> thought Chriſt had no ſoule, becauſe he underſtood not how he could take ſinfull fleſh, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2, 3. and not be ſinfull, and ſo he determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned him to be but halfe a man, and that his divinity ſupplied the place of the ſoule. Others ſtumbling at the conception of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, ſay, that in this Chriſts nature was ſanctified by the Holy Ghoſt, which cannot be but his humane nature by the Holy Ghoſt, was ſeparated in reſpect of the ſubſtance of it from the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> and in the ſame moment of conception, was united to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond perſon, and was holy in it ſelfe; for if it needed ſanctification, it needed juſtification. Now the effects of this conception, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonall union, are many. As 1. A communication of thoſe proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Chriſts perſon, which are in themſelves only proper to either nature,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.6.</note> as to ſay, the Son of man can forgive ſins, which is proper to the divine nature; ſo to aſeend where he was before; ſo to ſay when he was on earth, that the Son of man is in heaven, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.62. and his blood is called the blood of God, though proper only to man. 2. Effect of this union was a reception of gifts in his body and ſoule; for his body received the higheſt degree of perfection, that any body could attain unto, though it was not much revealed till his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (ſave in his transfiguration) after which it became impaſſible, and now ſhineth in heaven, far brighter then any other creature doth, or can do.</p>
                  <p>So upon his ſoule was poured knowledge, and love, beyond the meaſure in any creature, by vertue of this union: For his knowledge was ſuch by the light of nature, that he knew thereby all things that could be known by it, not only by experience of ſome things, but by reaſoning he could tell all thoſe things he had no experience of; for his own ſufferings he could tell all that we ſuffer, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18. And in this wiſedome he did grow and increaſe, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.52. and by this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge he knew more then any man. Beſide this, Chriſt had a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of infuſion, or revelation, by which heavenly are underſtood by the light of grace. By this he diſcerned ſpirituall things more clearly
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:37858:56"/>then any man, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 11.2. for the ſpirit of wiſedome and counſell, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and knowledge, did reſt upon him. Again, he had the knowledge of viſion to ſee God as the bleſſed do in heaven, yet excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding them all, he being the cauſe of bringing men to this bleſſedneſſe; and alſo, becauſe his ſoule is more neer to God by this union, then any others are.</p>
                  <p>And as knowledge was poured out on him by this union, ſo was divine charity more then upon all men, either juſt or good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.6, 7. As for faith or hope, he had them not, farther then as to depend on God, and expected thoſe things he ſaw by the knowledge of viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for he both ſaw God, and enjoied him. But faith is an evidence of things not ſeen, and hope argueth no preſent poſſeſſion of things hoped for.</p>
                  <p>Next he had the grace of office by this union of both natures, for hereby he was made a fit mediator between God and man, to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile us to God; yet ſo, as that the actions of the divine and humane nature, were not confounded, but each nature performed what was proper to it ſelfe, by the aſſiſtance of the other. As the humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was given as a ſacrifice for us, but the divine nature made it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, being offered up by the eternal ſpirit, which therefore might be rightly called the Altar which ſanctified the gift, rather then the croſſe, which only bore his body crucified.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, he had the grace of honour and worſhip due to his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, as it was united to the divine in one perſon; for alone, and ſeparated, it cannot lawfully have divine worſhip given to it, but ſo far as it is directed to him that is God and Man.</p>

                  <p>A Chriſtians life conſiſting in the meditation, comfort and practice of what Chriſt hath done. This union may move us firſt to admire the work it ſelfe; And ſecondly to conſider the glory of God therein; And thirdly, what comfort redounds to us thereby.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To admire this work, in which both mortality and immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality meet in one perſon. That the ſame perſon is uncreated and cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, without beginning, and yet takes a beginning, a man in nature, and yet God manifeſted in fleſh, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.16. In his divine nature he makes man, in the humane nature he delivers man.<note place="margin">Aug.</note> The Son of God becomes the ſon of man, not by changing what he was, but aſſuming what he once was not, taking what was ours, yet not diminiſhing what was his; for in this union, the divine majeſty did not conſume the humane, nor the humane diminiſh the divine. This high myſtery is rather to be beleeved then argued, namely, that it was, then how it was.</p>
                  <p>Next we are to conſider the glory of goodneſſe and wiſedome in this work. 1. His goodneſſe, who not only gave nature to us in cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, and grace to us by participation of his Image, but gives himſelf both to us and for us; in nature to us, in death for us. Then conſider Gods wiſdome in contriving a way to ſave mankind, who by ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God was loſt, and coming ſo in debt to God, none ought to pay it, but man that had offended; and yet none could pay ſuch an
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:37858:57" rendition="simple:additions"/>infinite debt but God. Upon this the attributes of God ſeem at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance. His wiſedome would ſave him, his mercy would damn him. His wiſedome moderates and finds a way, whereby what man could not pay in nature, he might in perſon: For God aſſumes manhood in the unity of the perſon, and ſo ſatisfieth himſelfe, upon which the attributes are reconciled, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 85.10. <hi>mercy and truth met, righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and peace kiſſed each other.</hi> For the offence which was infinite in regard of the object, God was ſatisfied by the infiniteneſſe of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected ſurety, Chriſt. Again, this union teacheth us, in practice to be like him in our ſelves, and to one another. In our ſelves to partake of him that hath ſtooped ſo low to partake of us. If he of our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties, then we ſhould deſire much more to partake of his graces. So we ſhould deſire to be like him one towards another, not pleaſing our ſelves, but rather our neighbours, for their good to edification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.1, 2. that the ſame mind may be in us, which was alſo in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.4, 5.</p>
                  <p>From this union we may receive alſo much comfort: As that our nature is taken into the ſociety of God in Trinity; by which our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is not only highly honoured, but comforted in all diſtreſſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he took our whole nature, with all our infirmities, ſin only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and therefore as he can help us becauſe he is God, ſo he will becauſe he is man, and ſo one of us. So it will encourage us to pray, and to made our wants known unto God, who certainly will deny us nothing fit for us, becauſe Chriſt in our nature pleads for us; yea, how can we deſpair of glory, ſince he became the Son of man, that we may be the ſons of God.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I conceive then that this Conception of Chriſt by the holy Ghoſt, was a production of humane nature from the bleſsed Virgin</hi> Mary, <hi>and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of it to the ſecond perſon aſsuming it.

                  <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, but her part was more ſpirituall then naturall. For ſhe firſt received the bleſſed meſſage by the ear from the good Angell <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel,</hi> as a counterpoiſon to the firſt temptation that <hi>Eve</hi> received from the devill. 2. She conceived it in her heart, to be the bleſſed will of God by faith. 3. She reſolved to be obedient to it, though ſhe knew not how it could be. 4. She contributed of her naturall ſubſtance to that divine and effectuall operation of the holy Ghoſt, by whoſe power ſhe was overſhadowed, and that part of her ſubſtance conveyed to the veſſell of conception, in regard whereof Chriſt was called the fruit of her womb, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.42. So that as <hi>Adam</hi> was aſleep while <hi>Eve</hi> was formed; ſo bleſſed <hi>Mary</hi> was as it were overclouded, while the humane nature of Chriſt was by the Holy Ghoſt united to, and aſſumed by, the Son of God.</p>

                     <hi>It is hard to conceive this point.</hi> 1. <hi>In regard of the manner how he was conceived by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> 2. <hi>In regard of what ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</hi> 3. <hi>In regard of Chriſt conceived, whether according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine eſsence?</hi>

               </sp>

                  <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
                  <p>Therefore you are to underſtand and beleeve, that in regard of the matter conceived, it was Chriſt man, but in regard of the perſon
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:37858:57"/>conceived, it was the ſecond perſon in Trinity, the Son of God, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.35. whom <hi>Iſa.</hi> calleth <hi>Immanuel;</hi> not that the bleſſed Virgin gave the divine nature to Chriſt, though ſhe was a mean of uniting the two natures; but the Son of God received the humane nature in her womb. 2. In regard of the manner how by the holy Ghoſt, it is not utterable, farther then the production of the ſubſtance of humane na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from her, and uniting of both natures in one perſon, <hi>i.</hi> Chriſt, which he did not as a father, though as a divine agent: For he did it not materially, by giving any thing out of himſelfe, but effectually ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to divine appointment. 3. In regard of Chriſt conceived,<note place="margin">Bern.</note> whether according to the divine eſſence? It is true, that every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in the Trinity hath the whole divine eſſence, but in a ſeverall man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of ſubſiſting: For the firſt perſon hath it as the Father, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond as the Son. Now Chriſt is ſaid to take the humane, not accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the eſſentiality of the Godhead, but the perſonality, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the Son, or ſecond perſon, or elſe he could not be a media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor between two, becauſe the eſſence of God is but one, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.20.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Whether did not ſin cleave to this conception, for it is ſaid, he was made ſin for us.</hi>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Phila.</speaker>
                  <p>He was made ſin for us. 1. By imputation, becauſe our ſins were charged upon him. 2. Becauſe he was made a ſacrifice for ſin; ſo ſome ſacrifices were called ſin offerings, <hi>Lev.</hi> 4.34. but he had no ſin in his nature; for he was not in <hi>Adam</hi> in reſpect of propagati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which originall ſin is conveyed, but in reſpect only of humane ſubſtance; ſo that though he was from him as others are, yet not by him as others are; for he came into the world by this wonderfull conception by the Holy Ghoſt, and a woman without man. Which woman though a ſinner in her perſonall ſubſiſtence, as comming by generation from <hi>Adam,</hi> yet her meer naturall ſubſtance ſimply conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out of that ſubſiſtence, cannot be called ſinfull; which ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance was only taken of Chriſt into his perſon, and the accident of ſin left, cleaving to her own perſon; of which Chriſt cleareth her, as being her Redeemer. And this appears more plain, if we conſider, that neither actions, nor affections, though called ſinfull, as they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from the perſon of man, yet are not ſinfull in themſelves, much leſſe is meer ſubſtance; ſo neither can a part of mans ſubſtance be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, if not the totall, but his perſon only: And thus Chriſts nature ſtands cleer of being infected with originall ſin in it ſelf, though ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated and conſecrated by the Holy Ghoſt for Chriſts aſſumption thereof. So that the old Hereticks, the Manicheans and Marcionites, had they rightly apprehended this conception, might have avoided the error of thinking that Chriſt had only an incorporeall body, from which only paſſed through the bleſſed Virgins body, thereby to avoid the ſtain of originall ſin. Nor <hi>Apollinaris</hi> need not have denied Chriſt an humane ſoule, and feign the Deity to ſupply that place, to avoid the ſame taint. Nor the Papiſts need not ſay (to avoid Chriſts ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full conception) that the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> was conceived without ſin; for then her parents muſt be ſo too, and theirs alſo, and ſo up to <hi>Adam,</hi> which is abſurd to think. Nor need ſome think that Chriſts humane
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:37858:58"/>nature by this conception was ſanctified, or cleanſed from originall ſin; for if it had ever been ſinfull, it could not have been ſanctified from ſin, without the blood of the covenant, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.22. and <hi>Ephe.</hi> 1.7. and ſo there muſt have been another Mediator beſide himſelfe, which St <hi>Paul</hi> denieth, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.5. there is but one Mediator, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus, the High Prieſt who is in himſelfe, holy, innocent, and undefiled, and ſeparate from ſinners, <hi>Heb.</hi>

For as it could not be propagated by his manner of conception, ſo neither could it be juſtly imputed to his perſon, which was both God and man. And for his death it was voluntary. Death did not by his own power prevaile over him, but he laid it down, <hi>John</hi> 10.17, 18. Nor did death fall upon him as a ſinner, but as the ſurety for ſin.</p>

                     <hi>He is oftentimes called in the Goſpell (even by himſelfe too) the Son of man, how then ſhall I conceive his conception to be more then hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane?</hi>

                  <p>His Conception and Birth are full of wonder, yet may be diſcerned with diſtinction; for it ſeems a new creation: For as he was the Son of God, no woman was his mother, and as he was man, he had no father. He is called the Son of man, becauſe he took our nature of the bleſſed Virgins ſubſtance. Yet he is called the Son of the moſt High, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1. becauſe he is the ſecond perſon in the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Which title is given to the nature aſſumed, becauſe it had no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence but in his perſon that was the naturall Son of God: In which regard the bleſſed Virgin is called the mother of God, not of his deity, but of this union of God and man; yet his perſon was not circumſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in her womb, though the humane nature was. But as his body is
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:37858:58"/>heaven locally, and is in the Word ſubſtantially, and in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment myſtically, and in the heart of a beleever ſpiritually; ſo it was in her body naturally.</p>

                  <p>He was born three waies; of his Father, of his Mother, and in the mind of man. Of his Father eternally, of his Mother tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, and in mans mind ſpiritually. For three things have relation to his birth, Deity, Fleſh, and Spirit. Of his Father he is born God for ever; of his Mother fleſh once; and in mans mind he is born Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit figuratively often. In reſpect of his divine nature he had a Father without a Mother; in regard of the humane nature, he had a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther without a Father; in reſpect of his ſpirituall nativity, he hath both Father and Mother, <hi>i.</hi> they that do his will. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, God was manifeſted in fleſh; 1. From the boſome of his Father, in whom he was concealed. 2. From the ſhadowes of the Law, in which he was prefigured. 3. From the womb of his Mother in which he was cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This was the greateſt and the moſt gracious work (conſidered in all the conſequences of it, as his death and reſurrection, which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this could not have been) that ever God wrought, who for theſe humiliations, gave him a name above all names, Jeſus, the Saviour.<note place="margin">Phil. 2.9.</note> Which name although others had as well as he in the Old Teſtament, yet they were but figures of him; yea, the name <hi>Jehovah</hi> ſignifieth but eſſence, <hi>i.</hi> God, as he is the author of being; but Jeſus ſignifieth God, our well being, a Saviour, then which there is no other name of ſalvation given, <hi>Act.</hi> It was the name of the eternall Word incarnate; it contains in it the whole oeconomy of the work of redemption, wherein the attributes of God are united; wiſedome, juſtice, peace,<note place="margin">Pſal. 85.</note> mercy and truth. This was well called his great work of a woman compaſſing a man. And wonderfull great it was in effect: For in the Creation God made man in his image, and ſo earth was honoured; but in Chriſts birth God made himſelfe in our image, and ſo heaven was debaſed. In creation God made all without reſiſtance; he ſpake but the word and they were made.<note place="margin">Heb. 12.</note> But in redemption he ſuffered contradictions of ſinners againſt himſelfe. In this work he did both ſpeak work and ſuffer; ſpeak graciouſly, work wonderfully, ſuffer unworthily. In creation the Word made fleſh, but in Jeſus our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer,<note place="margin">John 1.3.</note> the Word was made fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 1.14. In the creation God took man out of the earth, and placed him in Paradiſe; In the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he took man out of hell, and placed him in heaven, through Jeſus the Saviour.</p>

                  <p>Many. For among the heathen voices were heard, ſaying, that the great God was about to be born. At <hi>Rome</hi> a woman was ſeen about the Sun, having a child in her arms. And the <hi>Sybil</hi> told <hi>Auguſtus</hi> the Emperour, that that ſame child was greater then he, and bade him to adore him: He would never after be called Lord. The Temple of peace fell down at his birth, becauſe he brought better peace to the world. The Oracles were all ſtruck dumb by the birth of this eternall Word. <hi>Jupiters</hi> Oak in <hi>Dodona</hi> was ſhaken; the Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron,
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:37858:59"/>ſmitten with the rod in the hand of <hi>Jupiter.</hi> The Tripode in <hi>Delphis,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Nazi.</hi> in Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. annotat. Nomi.</note> the Laurell and fountain of <hi>Daphne,</hi> and the ramfaced image of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> could utter nothing; ſo that one effect of Chriſts birth, was Gods glory, and Satans confuſion. But further, another effect was, the good mans peace and ſalvation: For he was born to bring both to paſſe. 1. His ſalvation, being he was born to be a King, a Prieſt, and a Prophet, by which three offices he could effect all that belonged to mans ſalvation: To deliver as a King, to inſtruct him as a Prophet,<note place="margin">Acts 4.12.</note> to purge him from ſin, as a Prieſt. 2. To bring him to peace with God above him, and to peace about him with Angels and men, to peace within him in his conſcience, and to peace belowe him; for hell cannot hurt him though it would, all which may be gathered from the Angels ſong, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. But to the wicked it brought judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even to make them ſtumble and fall, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.34. becauſe he brought light, and men loved darkneſſe rather, <hi>John</hi> 3.19. Beſide, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing about his birth, but had ſome effectuall ſignification; for he was born at <hi>Bethelem,</hi> the houſe of bread, to ſhew that in effect he ſhould be the bread of the houſhold of faith. So born in the fulneſſe of time, when the Church was at the loweſt ebbe, and no hope on earth was left for it, to effect faith in the Church, that God could help, when all help in man was paſt. So he was born poor, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by not only made us rich, but alſo taught us with him to trample up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on world pomp and glory, ſince by lying in the manger, he procured us an heavenly manſion. And the very publiſhing of his birth unto the wiſemen and ſimple ſhepherds; to Gentiles and Jewes; to <hi>Anna</hi> as well as <hi>Simeon,</hi> ſhewed that his birth ſhould take effect on Jewes and Greeks; learned and ſimple; male and female, and all ſhould be one in Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.21.</p>

                     <hi>I pray tell me, how could Chriſt ſuffer being God and man?</hi> 2. <hi>Why he ſo ſuffered, and what is the effect of it upon us?</hi>

                  <p>For the firſt Quere how Chriſt ſuffered; We underſtand, that though the ſufferings of Chriſt belonged to his whole perſon, and ſo is attributed to both natures, yet only to the humane nature ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and to the divine relatively. For the divine nature cannot ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer being immutable, nor die, being immortall; yet as his perſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſteth of both natures, his ſufferings belonged to both. For the word divine was not ſevered from the humane nature, neither in his birth, nor ſuffering. Nor was the nature inviolable hurt by the ſufferings of the nature paſſible, no more then the beams of the Sun that ſhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth on a tree is wounded by the Axe that felleth the tree. And thus we are to underſtand thoſe phraſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. that God redeemed the Church with his blood, and 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.8. the Lord of Glory was crucified.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The reaſon why he ſuffered for us, as it was not caſuall, but by divine providence, the drops of his cup were meaſured by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate counſell and foreknowledge of God.</p>
                  <p>And this was ſo. 1. That the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.26, 27. and God found true of his word, juſt in all his waies, not ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his own Son, being but ſurety for us; how can wilfull ſinners
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:37858:59"/>expect to eſcape Gods wrath. 2. That he might revive the pattern of patience almoſt decaied and loſt, and leave it to us to imitate, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.21. That we might be conſecrated by affliction, as he the Prince of our ſalvation was. 3. That he might deliver us from the bondage of the ceremoniall Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Alſo that he being made ſenſible of our ſufferings, might become a more mercifull High Prieſt to us, and more apt to ſuccour us in temptations, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and 4.15. Beſide, he ſuffered that he might reconcile us to God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.18. by being made an expiation for us, and condemning our ſins in his fleſh, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53.5. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. For if one died for all, then are all dead to that fault for which he died: ſo that our diſeaſe of ſin is cured by the mediation of his paſſion, and by the ſpeciall vertue of his Ordinances, operating in us by the Holy Ghoſts application of Chriſts ſufferings to us. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that we might, being ſprinkled with his blood, enter within the vaile, namely, into heaven, the Holy of Holies; from whence for ſin we are ſhut out, as well as out of paradiſe.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. It teacheth, that thoſe ſufferings have relation only to the Son, not to the Father, nor to the Holy Ghoſt. 2. To wonder at this gracious work, that the Son of God ſhould be condemned by the ſons of men; that righteouſneſſe it ſelfe, ſhould be condemned by the unrighteous, that the God of order ſhould be corrected with rods; that the nower of God ſhould be weakned; ſalvation, woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and life killed. Alſo to think on the hatefulneſſe of ſin, that brings God to ſuffering; and to be pitifully affected with the ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of ſuch an eminent perſon; yet to wax ſtrong in faith, becauſe ſuch an one hath made ſatisfaction, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.7. and to be ready to ſuffer from wicked men, becauſe he did ſo, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.18. And farther, to diſtinguiſh rightly for whom he ſuffered. It was not for all, but for all the elect; therefore <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.28. it is ſaid, his blood is ſhed for many; for Chriſt will not know ſome, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.23. Nor did he pray for the world, but for thoſe that God gave him out of the world. So he gave his life for his ſheep, not for goats, nor ſwine; for his righteouſneſſe extends to all them that beleeve, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.22. As thoſe were only cured that looked on the brazen ſerpent, and turn from tranſgreſſion in <hi>Jacob, Iſa.</hi> 59.20. and are ruled by the voice of this Shepherd, and are conformed to his Image by afflictions; and that dedicate their lives and ſervices to him that died for them, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. All which ſhould make us. 1. To be affected with his love which was never paralleld.

To be ready to ſuffec for him, or for one another, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.16. And 3. To plead his ſufferings before God againſt our ſins, and ſatans accuſations, and not to feare, but that ſeeing ſuch a price is paid for our reconcilement, that God will ſave us being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled,

                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. And 4. Being this ſweet Paſſeover is ſacrificed for us, to purge away the old leaven of malice and wickedneſſe, and all corruptions, and become a new lump, full of ſincerity and truth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7, 8.</p>

                  <p>His ſuffering is a ſufficient ſatisfaction for all, becauſe of the dignity of his perſon, God and Man, which made his ſufferings of more value, then if all men and Angels had ſuffered; and though his death were but temporary, yet it is more then all mens ſuffering eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall damnation. 1.

                  <p>No, his whole life was a croſſe and martyrdome: For his ſufferings were privative and poſitive; the privative concerned both natures; his divine, becauſe it was voluntarily deprived of that glory, joy, and felicity which it had; for it was eclipſed while he dwelt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on earth,<note place="margin">John 17.5.</note> in a vaile of fleſh, and by the darkneſſe of mens hearts, who did not apprehend his glory. So to his humane nature did juſtly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long all joy and happineſſe, becauſe he did perfectly keep Gods Law, yet he did want it in the daies of his fleſh, for he was of no reputation, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.7. And this he ſuffered to bring us to perfect glory, and to teach us to hate ſin, which darkens the beams of Chriſts glory, and to be content to have our lives hidden in Chriſt, as his was, till he be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in glory, and we with him, <hi>Col.</hi> 3.3, 4.</p>
                  <p>He ſuffered alſo poſitively, and that, 1. In regard of evill impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him; for Gods juſtice charged all mans ſins upon him, as if he himſelfe had been guilty of them all, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21. he was made ſin for us, and bare our ſins in his body on the tree, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God cannot require us to anſwer for them alſo; but we may live comfortably in holineſſe, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and die in aſſurance of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſſe. 2. He ſuffered poſitively in regard of evill inflicted upon him, from his conception to his reſurrection, and all for us. For the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lediction of the Law, laid upon us not only death, but a wretched life, and therefore he ſuffered both, yet not ſickneſſe, nor the pains of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which are not common to all the nature of man, but ſpeciall judgements upon ſome particular men. But he ſuffered all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon miſeries of mans nature, which did concord to the free executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his office of Redemption. As 1. By the humility of his incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, to be made a man.<note place="margin">Luke 2. Phil. 2.</note> To come of mean parents, and to be born in a ſtable, and made of no account and reputation; and this to expiate the arrogancy of our firſt parents, who would be as God, therefore he is put beneath the loweſt condition of men. So he hides the glory of his eternall birth, by a temporary, to purchaſe for us a ſpirituall and heavenly birth; ſo to teach great men not to be proud of their birth, but ſeek the new birth, which is true honour and glory; and to comfort the poor, whoſe children have poor proviſion at their birth, and Chriſt had leſſe then they.</p>
                  <pb n="99" facs="tcp:37858:60"/>
                  <p>Again, he was mightily debaſed from his birth to his death; as by being forced to flye from his native Country to Aegypt, to aboliſh <hi>Adams</hi> ſin which exiled him from Paradiſe, and to repurchaſe heaven for us; and to comfort thoſe godly by his example, who ſuffer ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment.</p>
                  <p>Againe, for thirty years together, he lived obſcurely under <hi>Joſeph,</hi> as if he had been the Carpenters ſon, and ſo reputed, no man acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging him either as the Son of God, or the King of Iſrael, or the worlds Saviour, but was as a root ſpringing out of a drie ground,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.2.</note> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed and rejected of men. What need Gods children therefore be diſcontented if the world regard them not? Chriſt was ſo uſed. But theſe were but private ſufferings, the more publick began after his baptiſme. As 1. By being tempted of Satan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. in the deſart, where he overcame the arch enemy of mankind, in a ſingle duell. This was he led to by the ſpirit of God, not by any luſt of vain glory in himſelfe, that he might make our pilgrimage in this world ſafe and ſecure, and that he having experience of his temptations, might have ſympathy of ours, and be the more ready to help us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.17. and ſhew us a way how to put the devil to flight, even by quoting Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as he did, which is indeed the ſword of the ſpirit. It teacheth us alſo to beware of being led into temptation by our luſts, but let the ſpirit of God bring us to the combat, and he will bring us off with honor, as Chriſt was. For he leads us not by ſeducement of deceit, nor allureth us by inticements to evill, or by perſwaſions to venture upon any ſinfull way, but doth actuate us to combate with thoſe temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, which he foreſees are laied for us, that our vertues may be improved, and God glorified by ſuch probations of us. So it may juſtly comfort us in all temptations, that Chriſt having overcome the devill in our behalfe, hath merited victory for us.</p>
                  <p>His next ſuffering was extream poverty, and want of the comforts of this life, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20. he had not where to lay his head. He lived up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on alms, and borrowed an Aſſe: And this was to make us rich, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. yea, to make our ſelves poor by our liberality to others, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.9. and not to place our felicity in worldly things, nor ſeek great mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters for our ſelves, but be content with the meaneſt eſtate; Chriſt was as poor as any man. Beſide, he had infirmities like us, ſin only excepted, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15. He hungred and thirſted though he was the bread and water of life, and was weary, though the way to life: He was ſubject to anger, ſadneſſe, fear and ſorrow; and this was that he might merit ſtrength for us, and we be enabled in him. Further, he ſuffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red extream diſgrace from the Jewes; for they denied his divinity; his birth by a Virgin; nor would receive him as their King and Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, <hi>John</hi> 1.11. They reproached him alſo unjuſtly, and accuſed him of blaſphemy againſt God, and of ſeducing the people. Againſt the Magiſtrate with treaſon and ſedition; againſt his own ſoule, as if he had been a conjurer; ſo with gluttony and drunkenneſſe, and a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourer of ſinners; by which means the people were offended in him, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.3. All this fell upon him by the imputation of our ſins, who were guilty, though he was innocent, and therefore he ſpake but little
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:37858:61"/>in his own defence. Alſo that he might deliver us from eternall ſhame, and merit for us eternall glory, and that we might be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med for his ſake to ſuffer all reproaches, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3, 4. Beſide, he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went many dangers of being caſt down the clift of <hi>Nazareth</hi> head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, and of ſtoning by the Jewes. All which he ſuffered as the fruits and effects of our ſins, and to ſave us from everlaſting deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But above all this, he ſuffered his enemies to conſult his death, to be betraid by <hi>Judas,</hi> to be denied by <hi>Peter,</hi> to be forſaken by the reſt. And this he ſuffered for our perfidiouſneſſe in <hi>Adam;</hi> our forſaking God, and denying his truth, and beleeving the devill. Farther, a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter agony ſeized upon him in the garden, <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.38. not for fear of death, but of the tyranny of ſin, death, and the devill, which they had got over mankind.</p>
                  <p>Next, the great ingratitude of the moſt part of mankind; the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſion of little flocks; the ſcandall they might take at his death; the ſad ruine of the Jewes, which he foreſaw, and the wrath of God for mans ſin, of which now he began to have a ſenſe, as being ſurety for us. And all this he ſuffered without any perturbation of ſinfull paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And this was done ſurely to expiate our ſinfull fears, and doubts, and to encourage us in any terrors that ariſe from a troubled conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though they put us into great agonies.</p>
                  <p>But theſe were not all his ſufferings. For he ſuffered, 1. By the conſultation of his adverſaries the Prieſts, Scribes, and Phariſees, who when they ſhould have been preparing for the Paſſeover, they were conſulting how to take away the true Paſchall Lambs life; and would have done it at that time, but that they feared the people more then they feared God. 2. He ſuffered by the treaſon of <hi>Judas,</hi> one of his own diſciples, whom he made ſteward of his family, and had waſhed thoſe feet that were ſo apt to ſhed his blood. And this he ſuffered, 1. That the Scripture might be fulfilled that foretold it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> and <hi>Joh.</hi> 13.8. 2. To beware of coverouſneſſe, which will make a man even to betray Chriſt at any rate. 3. To fore warn Miniſters of all others, to take heed of being corrupted this way, leſt they become like ſalt that hath loſt his ſavour. 4. To teach us to beware of ſin, under what pretenſe ſoever. For it is likely that <hi>Iudas</hi> did not intend to have Chriſt killed, but only to get the mony, ſuppoſing that he would make an eſcape; which may be argued from that that he was ſo trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled when he ſaw he was condemned. Alſo to beware of the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt beginnings of ſin. For at the firſt, <hi>Iudas</hi> his ſin was but diſcontent, that he loft the gain of <hi>Mary</hi> her ointment, and ſhe juſtified in her deed. By this the devill entred his heart, that he reſolved to ſell the anointed, becauſe he could not ſell the ointment.</p>
                  <p>His next ſuffering was by being apprehended by wicked hands, to unlooſe the hold of ſin and Satan from us; and in a garden to expi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate the ſin committed in Paradiſe. Then bound to unlooſe the bands of wickedneſſe, and the works of the devill. Then toffed from pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar to poſt; from one High Prieſt to another. Then abuſed by the ſouldiers and Jewes,<note place="margin">Luke 22.</note> who buffeted that face which the holy Patriarchs and Prophers longed to behold, <hi>Cant.</hi> 8.1. And ſcoffed at his prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cying,
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:37858:61"/>which never failed. But it is no wonder, if they that had ſcorned the Prophet of the Lord, did alſo ſcoffe the Lord of the Prophets. This was done to him to expiate our ſinne of mocking God, as if he could not ſee, and our loſing of his glorious image; yet he would not die in a tumult, but was ſolemnly brought before the Judge, and there falſely accuſed, to free us from his that accuſeth the brethren: And received ſentence of death unjuſtly, to ſave us from the ſentence of Gods condemnation: So he was charged with ſedition and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy, to free us by his attonement from the guilt of high treaſon a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt God. To all which he anſwered not, ſaving to the High Prieſt, that he was the Son of God, becauſe he conjured him by the name of God to tell him. And to <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he was a King, though his Kingdome was not of this world, that he might leave the Jewes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out excuſe, and take away the occaſion from <hi>Pilate,</hi> of juſtly condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning him; and to fulfill the Scripture,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.7.</note> that he was like a ſheep dumb before the ſhearer; and to comfort his people that they have a King in Sion, though he regardeth not worldly glory.</p>

                  <p>He ſaid he was a King, but ſuch an one that meant not to ſtickle for worldly glory, which ſeemeth ſtrange, becauſe God had promiſed to give him the throne of <hi>David,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 1.32, 33.</note> and that he ſhould reign over the houſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> for ever, but that is meant not literally but ſpiritually, which teacheth not to expect that true Religion ſhould ſtand in outward glory, but pray that the eies of our underſtanding being opened, we may ſee wherein conſiſts the glory of Chriſts King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome,<note place="margin">Eph. 1.19. Col. 3.2.</note> and therefore to employ our ſelves about heavenly things, and not earthly things; for our trading conſiſteth in ſuch commodities, as appeareth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. for he never promiſed any great earthly poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to his followers, as that Impoſtor <hi>Mabomet</hi> did, but exhorted them to ſeek the preferments of his ſpirituall Kingdome. 2. He ſaid he came to bear witneſſe of the truth; which though <hi>Pilate</hi> ſcof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fed at it, ſaying, what is truth, yet it was a truth; for not ſubmitting to which, the Devill was caſt down, and all men are damned that wil not beleeve it <hi>(viz.)</hi> that all creatures that are capable of eternall happineſſe, muſt attain to it by dependance upon the Son of God; by which we are informed what poor entertainment truth finds in the world, that Chriſt is fain to deſcend from heaven to avouch it There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us receive the truth with all reſpect, and ſtand for it to the death; for ſo we ſhall prove our ſelves of the truth, and to be his ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>Now he would ſay no more to <hi>Pilate</hi> in his defence, leſt he ſhould ſeem to endeavor to prevent the ſentence of death. By which ſilence he ſatisfieth God for our laviſh tongues, and that he might merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly plead for us in heaven. Nor would he confeſſe himſelfe the Son of God to <hi>Pilate,</hi> becauſe <hi>Pilate</hi> was uncapable of the doctrine of the Trinity; and alſo becauſe it was no time now to reveal his Deity, but to die in his humanity. This filence did ſo amaze <hi>Pilate,</hi> that he ſought to ſave him, or at leaſt to put his condemnation over to
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:37858:62"/>others. And therefore firſt offers to the Jewes to judge him by their law, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18.31. which they refuſing, brought to paſſe what Chriſt had ſortold <hi>(viz.)</hi> what death he ſhould die, namely, the Romane death of the Croſſe; by which we may ſee that all the policy of men cannot diſappoint the purpoſe of God in his childrens ſufferings. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their refuſing, <hi>Pilate</hi> ſends him to <hi>Herod,</hi> who ſet him at naught with his men of war, becauſe he would not ſpeak to <hi>Herod,</hi> nor ſhew any miracle before him,<note place="margin">Luk. 23.8, 9, 10</note> thereby ſhewing how little he eſteemed of <hi>Herods</hi> greatneſſe, that would not feed the lightneſſe and vanity of his mind, by caſting his pearls before ſuch a ſwine. This ſcorn of <hi>Herod</hi> and his ſouldiers he ſuffered, that we might be eſteemed of God, and his holy army of Angels. <hi>Herod</hi> finding no fault in him, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.15. yet he ſends back to <hi>Pilate,</hi> and in ſcorn of his claim to a Kingdom, puts him on a white robe, proper to the Princes of Gali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lee. But what he did in jeſt, God ratifieth in earneſt, approving him to be his King, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2. and the pure Immaculate Lamb of God. Now <hi>Pilate</hi> ſeeing he could not way ſhift it off, matcheth Chriſt with a moſt notorious offender and murtherer called <hi>Barrabas,</hi> and offered them their cuſtome, to let them looſe a priſoner at that Feaſt of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, which ſhould be one of them two, ſuppoſing they would have choſen the moſt innocent of the two. But they mad with envy at Chriſt, refuſed the Lord of Life, and choſe a murtherer to be given them, for which they themſelves forty years after, were murthered at the ſiege of <hi>Ieruſalem;</hi> for they preferred a robber before him, who thought it no robbery to be equall with God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. This was to expiate our fin, who preferred the Devill that was a murtherer from the beginning, before God bleſſed for ever. In which ſin they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to this day, that chuſe the company of wicked perſons, before Gods children. Next <hi>Pilate</hi> uſeth another moſt unjuſt policy, who finding no fault in him, yet would have him ſcourged in the common Hall, and alſo mocked by the ſouldiers, in hope to make the Jewes re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent when they beheld the man who was of their own nation, ſo hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly uſed by Gentiles. But nothing would ſoften their flinty and ada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mantine hearts, but the blood of this innocent Kid. Theſe ſcourges he ſuffered,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.24.</note> to deliver us from the eternall ſcourge of God, and to ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie all his temporall ſcourges to us; and to teach us to ſuffer patiently, if we be beaten undeſervedly. <hi>Pilate</hi> at laſt being overcome by the clamors of the people, and their threatnings, that if he let Chriſt go, he was not <hi>Caeſars</hi> friend, condemns him to be crucified, which was lamentable, yet comfortable; for now did God give ſentence upon our fins, and condemned ſin in Chriſts fleſh, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we need not fear condemnation at the laſt day of judgement.</p>

                     <hi>Pilate</hi> having condemned him; he was ſcorned and ſcoffed by the ſouldiers, with a painfull crown of thorns, a reedy ſcepter, and a purple robe, and ſaluted King of the Jewes in jeſt. But God made it all good to him, when he made this rejected ſtone the head of the corner. In the mean time it did argue the blindneſſe of the world,
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:37858:62"/>who cannot judge of the glory of Chriſts Kingdome, and therefore make a ſcorn of it, becauſe it conſiſts much in tribulation. But this ſuffering was that he might expiate the ſcorns and injuries that we have done to God, and ſpitting in his face by foule blaſphemies. And ſtripped he was, to reſtore unto us the garments of righteouſneſſe, which in <hi>Adam</hi> we had loſt. Clothed in red to ſulfill the prophecie, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 63.1. which hath relation to his blood, as well as his robe. Crow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with thorns, to merit for us a crown of glory. A reed he had, to ſhew that by that weak ſcepter he could break the ſerpents head. They took off his purple robe again, which ſhewed that one day his Kingdome of grace ſhould take an end, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. And his own gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were put on again, which ſhewed that at laſt he would be clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with his own righteouſneſſe as with a cloak, far more glorious then all worldly ornaments. Next they carry him out to be crucifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and make him carry his own croſſe till he fainted under it. In this he anſwered to <hi>Iſaac</hi> his type, who carried the wood,<note place="margin">Gen. 23.6.</note> upon which he ſhould be offered. Alſo to ſhew, that he took the curſe of the Law upon his own ſhoulders. It is true, that they compelled <hi>Simon</hi> of <hi>Cyrene</hi> to carry it; but this was that God will ſend us ſome help in afflictions; and that we muſt be content to bear a part in Chriſts croſſe, for as Chriſts afflictions are theirs by imputation;<note place="margin">Col. 1.24.</note> ſo theirs are Chriſts by ſympatheticall affection. Beſide, I beleeve he ſuffered ſome griefe at the womens lamenting him; and therefore bids them not weep for him that was dying, but the Jewes that were living, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom and their children, horrible deſtruction ſhould fall, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their own vote, His blood be upon us and our children: For if it be thus done in the green tree, what ſhall be done with the dry; if judgement begin at the houſe of God, where ſhall the ungodly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; for if ſuch ſuffer from men, how much more ſhall the wicked ſuffer from God. Next he comes to <hi>Golgotha,</hi> where he was to be crucified, ſignifying the place of a ſcull; not becauſe <hi>Adams</hi> ſcull was found there, as ſome write; for I ſuppoſe his ſcull was as hard to be known, as <hi>Moſes</hi> body of late pretended to be found: but rather it was ſo called from the ſculs and dead bones of malefactors there executed, whoſe ſtench no doubt was offence to him, but to us a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; for he thereby juſtifieth us in the place of condemned perſons, and ſo delivers us from the place of eternall judgement. Thus he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> as one unfit for mens ſociety, and like the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offering for the people was burnt without the camp.<note place="margin">Lev. 6.30.</note> This teacheth us, that here we muſt look for no abiding City, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.14. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt be content to go to him without the gate,<note place="margin">Heb. 13.13.</note> bearing his reproach; that though we be caſt out of earthly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> yet we may poſſeſſe the heavenly, through him that hath delivered us from the defilement of the dead things of this <hi>Golgotha,</hi> and preſents us pure to ſerve the living God. Now being there he was offered wine ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with myrrhe, <hi>Mark</hi> 15.23. by ſome well-wiſhers it may be to make him leſſe ſenſible of pain; but he would not drink that, which might any way diminiſh his pains, which he deſired to ſuffer to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt:
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:37858:63"/>However, it was changed by the malice of the Jewes and ſoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, into vinegar mingled with gall,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.34.</note> of which he taſted, but would not drink. By this cup he paied for our inordinate appetites and glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony in the forbidden frnit; and ſheweth how little comfort we muſt look for in this world, which commonly addeth ſorrow to ſorrow, gall to vinegar, as we have added ſin to ſin. All this being ſuffered, they nailed him hand and foot to the Croſs. And this to ſhew, 1. That he was the Meſſiah promiſed, <hi>John</hi> 2.28. Alſo that by this accurſed death, he might derive the curſe of the Law upon himſelfe, that we might have the bleſſing, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. Alſo that we might be ſo fixed to his Croſſe by love, that we might not ſerve that ſin, which by his Croſſe he hath aboliſhed. And further, that the hand writing of the Law might be cancelled, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14. that our ſins might be no more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred: ſo that Chriſt is to be conſidered as a propitiatory Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, Prieſt, and Altar. Prieſt he was everlaſting, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. A Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice he was in his manhood, not Euchariſticall, but expiatory, offered up whole like the Holocauſt for ſin, which was burned up to aſhes by the fire of Gods wrath. And his Godhead was the ſpirituall Altar, called the eternall ſpirit, by which he offered up himſelfe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. yet the Croſſe might be taken as a materiall Altar, upon which his body was laid; for though the Altar ſanctifieth the gift as it is the utenſill of Gods inſtiſtution, yet he that ſanctifieth himſelfe, may ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Altar too by his own oblation; the fruit whereof made a bleſſed attonement by the ſweet ſavour thereof, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. for all thoſe that are crucified with him, by croſſing their own corrupt natures, and that look upon Chriſt by faith, as on the brazen Serpent that cured the people, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.14. and alſo to conſecrate themſelves to God, as a living ſacrifice to his ſervice, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1.</p>

                  <p>He was crucified naked, to ſatisfie for <hi>Adams</hi> loſing the garment of innocence, and might uncloath us of mortality, (of which the skins given to <hi>Adam</hi> for cloathing was an Emblem) and cloath us with his merits; alſo, that he and we might enter into heaven naked, as <hi>Adam</hi> did into earthly paradiſe; ſo to comfort us, that when the world and death ſtrips us naked of all we have, to ſuffer it joyfully; for we ſhall find a cloathing from heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. when mortality ſhall be ſwallowed up of life; and therefore to be content in the mean time,<note place="margin">Lignum mortis. Lignum vitae.</note> that the world be crucified to us, and we to the world. Again, he was faſtned to the wood, that death might be driven out of the world by a tree, as it came in by a tree, and life brought back to us again. He was laied on the croſſe, as <hi>Iſaac</hi> on the wood; and nailed as foretold, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.17. they digged my hands and my feet; alſo, that all bils and bonds of law againſt us, might be nailed with him to his Croſſe.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2.14.</note> Then he was lifted up that he might carry our ſins from the earth, and conquer the ſpirits that rule in the aire, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. He was crucified with his hands ſpread, as reaching them out to embrace both Jewes and Gentiles, that are not a gainſaying people. His blood was
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:37858:63"/>ſhed on the Croſſe to anſwer all the ſacrifices of the Law, without which there had been no remiſſion, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.18. whereas it is now an univerſall medicine for all our ſoules languiſhing, 1 <hi>John</hi> 17. and obtaineth for us eternall redemption, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. Beſide, he was crucified between two theeves, 1. Becauſe it was foretold that he ſhould be reckoned among the tranſgreſſors. 2.<note place="margin">Eſa. 53.12.</note> That he might ſanctifie the death of repenting malefactors; for his death in ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect was to be divided among ſinners, of whom at laſt he would be Judge, while ſome ſtand on his right hand, and ſome on his left, as the bad and repenting Theefe hung. Now while he hung on the Croſſe alive, he ſuffered, beſide the paine, 1. The diviſion of his garments, and caſting lots on his veſture, as was prophecied, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.19. 2. To ſhew that his very enemies ſhould partake of his graces. 3. Into four parts, to ſhew that his good grace ſhould edifie the four parts of the world. So the not dividing his other coat, ſhewed that his righteouſneſſe ſhould be applied whole to every beleever. And the caſting lots for it, argued that no man had his merits by their deſerving, but by the meer gift of God,<note place="margin">Col. 1.12.</note> who diſpoſeth of the Lot. To all which miſery, they added deriſion, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.39. wagging their heads, and upbraiding him with his words of deſtroying and building the Temple in three daies;<note place="margin">Yet it was truth in his ſenſe of his reſurrection, <hi>ut praedixit ſit revixit.</hi>
                     </note> and mocking at his miracles, ſaying, he ſaved others, but himſelfe he cannot ſave. Others mocked at his truſt in God. Others at his praiers, as if he called upon <hi>Elias</hi> to ſave him; which he ſuffered, that we might know the abominableneſs of our ſins, that heaped ſuch contempt upon the Son of God. Alſo that we might be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from the ſcorn of this world, and enjoy the comfort of our repute from God and a good conſcience,<note place="margin">Heb. 12.3.</note> without reviling the world again. Nay, more, they blaſphemed God, as if he could not deliver him, as the wicked ſaid, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22. with whom they join iſſue, and ſo condemn themſelves to be of the wicked crew, even like theeves, who alſo did the ſame. But beſide all this, he ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered great torments both in body and mind. In body, by hanging on the Croſſe by his nailed hands and feet; ſo that his heart might be rightly ſaid to be melted like wax, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.15. This was under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone to ſatisfie for our deſpiſing the threatning, and the power of God in puniſhing thoſe ſins we had committed in the body; alſo to free us from eternall torments, and to ſanctifie whatſoever pains we ſuffer in the body by diſeaſes, or from perſecutors. So he ſuffered anguiſh in ſoule, when he cried out, my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me; which ſome writers take to be meant of his deſcending into hell: for now God ſeemed to deſert him, by deferring his deliverance, and by withdrawing from his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, the divine ſupport of comfort, that he being ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of them, we might be delivered from them, by his merito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſuffering them. Yet we are not to conceive, that the divine nature of the Sonne did forſake the humane, but that the union was obſcured or eclipſed; nor that God the Father forſook him
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:37858:64"/>quite, but permitted his humane nature as ſurety to feele what was due to the principall. And this firſt confutes thoſe that think he ſuffered not in ſoule, though the Prophet ſay he made his ſoule an offering for ſin. And if not in ſoule, his bitter cry argued more impatience then the Martyrs had. It alſo may comfort men in their diſtreſſe of mind, ſince Chriſt was forſaken for a time; and ſurely it ſhould work in us a feare of ſin, that made God thus to deale with his only Son, whom he ſpared not, being only the principall; how terrible will he be againſt unrepenting ſinners, whom he will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forſake for ever; and to make us conſider with commiſeration, thoſe that are troubled in mind; a wounded ſpirit who can bear. No wonder if many of them cry out they be damn'd, of whom we are to judge charitably, ſince Chriſt complains of Gods forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him, through fear, whom yet he calleth his God by faith. Laſtly, he through paine ſuffereth thirſt, and they to adde to his miſery, gave him vinegar, and ſo they fulfilled the Scripture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> 69.22. and he compleated our redemption, ſaying, it is fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed.</p>

                  <p>No, God left him not without witneſſe. For <hi>Pilats</hi> ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſcription, (Jeſus that <hi>Nazarene,</hi> that King of the Jewes) God would not it ſhould be altered, being a plain affirmation of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, which otherwiſe <hi>Pilate</hi> might poſſibly have done as well, as to crucifie him at their importunity. Now in that God doth thus acknowledge his name Jeſus upon the Croſſe, he thereby teſtified that he accepted him for our Saviour, as Jeſus ſignifieth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.22. and will not deny thoſe that beleeve on him; yea, God exalts him in that name which the Jewes deſpiſed; ſo that he will honour thoſe whom the world reproacheth; yea, he will have him now known to be that King, his firſt born, higher then the Kings of the earth; and at this time of his diſgrace too, to ſhew, his Kingdome ſtands not in outward obſervation; nor is his roialty loſt, by outward abaſements: for even now like a King he paied the blood-roiall-ranſome for his elect, even among the Jewes themſelves, of whoſe repenting people he was King, by whoſe power they were converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. This title was written in the three generall known languages, to ſhew that every tongue ſhould confeſſe to his glory of Jeſus, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.11. when the Goſpell ſhould be preached to the nations. This title <hi>Pilate</hi> would not alter in one tittle, to ſhew that we ſhould not loſe one jot of the faith of Chriſt, and indeed whoſoever doth it, or ſuffers it to be done by Hereticks, or Sectaries, are worſe then <hi>Pilate</hi> himſelfe. Again, God honoured him, by making nature ſuffer an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſe of darkneſſe, as if to ſhew the Sun of righteouſneſſe did now ſet, and that the Jewes ſhould be left in blindneſſe, and all others that did not beleeve in him. Alſo, that nature abhorred the fact, and that God hereby did threaten the ſins of men, as <hi>Joel</hi> 2.10. and that he that now ſuffered was more then a man, for whoſe ſake ſuch a miracle was
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:37858:64"/>wrought. Next he was glorified by one of the malefactors converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and confeſſion; which ſhewed Chriſts power and mercy, and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice; his power, that he did and could work on him in the midſt of his anguiſh; his mercy, that he would ſave one at the laſt gaſp, that none may deſpaire; and his juſtice, that he would ſave but one, that none might preſume upon late repentance. Laſtly, he was glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the vaile of the moſt holy place rending of it ſelfe; which ſhewed that God did now abhor the Jewes Temple, and diſſolve their religious rites, and utterly rejected them, for rejecting Chriſt his Son.

Chriſt therefore being mans ſurety,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.3.</note> and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king on him the ſimilitude of our ſinfull fleſh, God condemns ſin in his fleſh, by putting him to death, and ſatisfieth his juſtice for all the elect by one; who though he was but one, yet being both God and Man, his death is of infinite price to make ſatisfaction to Gods infinite juſtice; who had told the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> that if he eat of the forbidden fruit, he ſhould die that day. And that day he became mortall;<note place="margin">Rom. 5.12.</note> for then death began to ſeize upon him and all his poſterity.

                  <p>Herein you muſt beware what you conceive: for if you think he died in both natures, divine and humane, or in his whole per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon as God and man, you erre from the faith, and prophane his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: therefore you are to beleeve; that though the fleſh of Chriſt only died, in reſpect of the nature that died, yet this death having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the eternall word by union, the Lord of life and glory, may be ſaid relatively to ſuffer, in which reſpect his blood is called the blood of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. Therefore though death made a ſeparation
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:37858:65"/>of his humane ſoule from his humane body, yet both ever ſubſiſted in the divine nature, firmly united. For if there had been a new manner of ſubſiſting, then Chriſt muſt be conceived to have two perſons as well as two natures.</p>

                  <p>He was actually ſlain toward the end of the world, namely, in the year of the world,<note place="margin">Scalig.</note> 3982. and in the 34. year of his age, and on Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day the fifth day of our week, which that year was the fifteenth day of the Jewes month, called <hi>Niſan,</hi> which that year was the ſeventh day of our <hi>April,</hi> as ſome account, yea, at the ninth hour of that day, the time of the evening ſacrifice, <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.46.

                  <p>No doubt but every particular conſequent of his death, hath ſome myſtery in it.<note place="margin">Exod. 12.46.</note> As 1. In that a bone of him was not broken, to ſhew that he was the true paſchall Lamb ſacrificed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.6. anſwering to the Jewes Paſſeover, which was ſo to be handled, <hi>Exod.</hi> 12.46. So his ſide was pierced with a ſpear by a ſouldier, <hi>John</hi> 19.34. Firſt, to fulfill Scripture, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. they ſhall look on him whom they have pierced. Alſo to anſwer to <hi>Adam,</hi> whoſe ſide was opened when <hi>Eve</hi> was formed: ſo was Chriſt, when the Church Chriſtian was to be framed. So the water and blood that iſſued from that wound, was both miraculous and myſticall. 1. Miraculous, that the water contained in the <hi>pericardium</hi> about the heart, was not dried up with the anguiſh that he endured, and by the heat of the heart in that extremity. 2. It was myſticall, ſhewing the difference between him and his forerunners. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſhewed a bodily deliverance of <hi>Iſrael</hi> by water of the red ſea; <hi>Joſhua</hi> by <hi>Jordan. John</hi> the Baptiſt ſhewed a ſpirituall deliverance by water in baptiſme; but Chriſt was he that came by water and blood, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7, 8. By water of ſanctification to waſh us from the ſtain of ſin, and by the blood of expiation, to make attonement with God for the guilt of ſin. So the earthquake ſhewed his divine power, by which he made the earth do him homage, though man would not; whereby the ſenſleſſe creature condemned the ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of men. As alſo it foreſhewed how the doctrin of his death ſhould ſhake all worldly ordinances. So the renting of the rocks, ſhewed how the doctrin of his death ſhould rent the hearts of men; the godly hearts by ſorrow, the wicked by horror; yea, the confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the Centurion, that he was the Son of God, ſhewed Chriſts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:37858:65"/>power, that though his Diſciples forſook him, yet he raiſed up pagans to acknowledge him.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, that the Scripture might be fulfilled, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 53.9. and that being buried, might be known to be dead; and alſo might o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome death in his own den, and might bury our ſins with him from the ſight of God, who are buried with him by baptiſme, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.12. and might take away from us the horror of the grave: yea, no doubt alſo to teach Chriſtians to bury each other decently, as thoſe that have a part in Chriſts death, and in the hope of his reſurrection. He was buried in a known place, that his buriall might not be doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of: and neer to the City <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which ſignified the viſion of peace, that men may know our reſt came by him, who bore the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſement of our peace. He was laied to reſt in a garden, becauſe troubles aroſe from ſin committed in a garden. And his ſepulchre was in a rock, to ſhew that our ſtony hearts muſt be digged before Chriſt can lodge there. And it was a new ſepulchre; to ſhew that his reſt place is only in that heart that is made new. And in this no man was ever laid, leſt ſome ſhould ſay it was ſome other man that roſe; or that he roſe by vertue of ſome holy man there buried, as 2 <hi>Kin.</hi> 13.21. So he was buried another mans ſepulchre; to ſhew that no grave belonged to him, becauſe he was no ſinner; and that therefore he was buried for other men, not for himſelfe; and that graves are propërly made for ſinners, not for him that was their Saviour.</p>

                  <p>He makes mention of <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> and <hi>Nicodemus</hi> now, becauſe they doe now a more worthy work then ever before; to ſhew that God will honor them that honor Chriſt; by which we may be encouraged in well doing. Now was that prophecie fulfilled, that he made his grave with the wicked and the rich. The wicked was <hi>Pilate,</hi> whoſe leave was craved; and thoſe malefactors that lay buried not far off. And the rich were theſe two Senators, who ſhew more Chriſtian courage for Chriſt now dead, and inſulted over by his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, then when he triumphed by his miracles. So ſhould we to his members, in the depth of their adverſity. They are the moſt noble Chriſtians that will ſhew themſelves to the Church, friends in her tribulation; and to Chriſt profeſſors in perſecution. This argued the powerfull working of God, in theſe who hid their profeſſion for fear of the Jewes, and now are more bold then the beſt of his Diſciples. It is dangerous cenſuring of men: for though ſome ſeem good, and are not, ſo others ſeem bad, and yet are good: even as ſome are wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer then they ſeem, ſo others ſeem wiſer then they are. But you will object, that if they were ſo zealous, they need not have asked <hi>Pilates</hi> leave to do ſo charitable a work. Now the Evangeliſts ſet this down, to ſhew that there might be the leſſe doubt made of his death, becauſe the Judge gave leave to bury him. Alſo, that though they knew God could mollifie the heart of <hi>Pilate,</hi> of himſelfe to command his buriall, yet <hi>Joſeph</hi> thought fit to ſhew his reſpect to authority, by asking his
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:37858:66"/>leave. Zeale without diſcretion, is like ſacrifice without ſalt, not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted with God. Having obtained leave, they perform it haſtily, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was the preparation to the ſabbath; to teach all men to do their neceſſary occaſions before that, yea, that our outward ſolemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, though it favour of charity, yet muſt not obſtruct piety. Alſo they did it openly to take away all ſuſpicion of fraud in his buriall. And they did it coſtly, to teach us that we muſt ſpare neither labor nor coſt, to ſerve Chriſt living or dead, in himſelfe, or in his members. He was wrapped in fine linnen, to argue his innocence; and with ſpices, to ſhew the ſweet memoriall of the bleſſed; and what a ſweet odour ſhould ariſe from his buriall in the hearts of all beleevers. But yet he was not imbalmed, not only becauſe the time was too ſhort to do it, but becauſe we ſhould know that his body needed nothing to preſerve it, but Chriſts own divine power; and alſo to prevent any cavill, as that he was thereby preſerved from corruption. Now it is noted, that this was done after the manner of the Jewes buryings, to ſhew us that cuſtomes may be obſerved,<note place="margin">Mat. 27.59. Heb. Goler.</note> being not forbidden in Scripture. It is ſaid, they rowled a great ſtone to the mouth of the ſepulchre, not only to ſecure his body from any vile uſage, but that the glory of Chriſt might the more appear in removing this ſtone when he roſe: yea, the women being there, had a myſtery in it, namely, to ſhew how God can make the weakeſt ſtrong enough to ſtand againſt the enemies of Chriſt, by an open profeſſion of him; as the watching and ſealing up of the ſepulchre, did but the more manifeſt his reſurrection by thoſe ſouldiers, being witneſſes that he roſe in ſpight of all their power and policy. So his lying in the grave three daies, was to anſwer to <hi>Ionas</hi> his type in the whales belly, and to make good the prophecie of <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea</hi> 6.2. after two daies he will revive us, and the third day he will raiſe us, and we ſhall live in his ſight. But you will ſay, he did not lie in the grave three whole daies and nights; yet according to the Jewiſh account, he might be ſaid ſo to do; for a day is reckoned by evening and morning. Now the former evening, and Good Friday on which he was buried, made the firſt day; then Friday evening, and the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath following, made the ſecond day; and the Sabbath evening, and the next morning of his Reſurrection was the third day. It may be you may think it ſtrange, that Chriſt would lie in the grave on the Sabbath day: but this he did, to ſhew the work of redemption was finiſhed; and therefore he reſted the ſeventh day, as God was ſaid to do, after the ſix daies work of creation. Alſo to ſhew, that with him was buried the ceremoniall part of the Sabbath, namely, the ſeventh day formerly appointed. And ſurely the firſt Chriſtians ſo under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it, and therefore they kept their holy meeting afterward upon the firſt day of the week,<note place="margin">Rev. 1.</note> which St <hi>Iohn</hi> called the Lords day. Now in all this time Chriſts body corrupted not. Firſt, becauſe he was without ſin, which is the cauſe of corruption; and therefore he was preſerved by the power of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. Beſide, men that die vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent deaths, are not ſo apt to corrupt, as thoſe that die of diſeaſes, by which they are partly corrupted before they are dead, otherwiſe a dead body may poſſibly be without corruption ſixty hours, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:37858:66" rendition="simple:additions"/>and Chriſt was dead not much above forty, and ſo might juſtly be ſaid not to ſee corruption. By all which he gave us a pledge of an eternall ſabbath of reſt; and that our bodies after death ſhould riſe incorruptible. And this doctrin of Chriſts buriall, is full of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and inſtruction. Of comfort, becauſe that now this ſtorm of Gods anger is allaied by our <hi>Jonas,</hi> being caſt into this whales belly of the grave, which by his body is fanctified for us. It teacheth us alſo to bury our ſins with Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. and there let them lie as dead carcaſſes, ſeparated from us for ever, and grow loathſome, and at laſt wear out of memory in reſpect of either by affection or practice, and we may live to newneſſe of life, by vertue of Chriſts reſurre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>

                  <p>You put a Queſtion of great controverſie, yet of more then needs, if the phraſe of hell were rightly underſtood.

This term or word held long among the Jewes, and Chriſt uſed it as the vulgar expreſſion in his time. <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.22. yet <hi>Luke</hi> 16.23. he uſeth another word as it is in the Greek text, namely <hi>Hades,</hi> which there ſignifieth hell; for it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Hades.</note> the rich man was in hell in torments.

If taken for the waters, what ſhould he do there,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 3.19.</note> except you will ſuppoſe that he went to preach to the rebellious ſpirits that were there impriſoned for their diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience in the daies of <hi>Noah.</hi> But how he went, and when, and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: how whether in ſoule or body, or both: then in what time; whether before he roſe, or afterward: and why; whether to preach for their converſion, or to confirm their damnation, would be reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved: or whether he went thither to ſuffer any thing, or to triumph: ſurely not to ſuffer for us; for on the croſſe all his ſufferings were fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed: nor to triumph, for that he did upon his croſſe, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.14, 15. Beſide, we are to conſider where Hell ſhould be, if Chriſt deſcended
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:37858:67"/>locally thither: for we conceive it to be a place ordained for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill and his angels, and wicked men. Now if the Devill and his be not yet confined thither, what ſhould Chriſt deſcend thither for, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to confirm damnation, or to triumph over them that were not there. Now that they are not yet confined to the place appointed, is plain, becauſe St <hi>Paul</hi> calleth him the Prince that ruleth in the aire; becauſe yet they have great liberty in tempting men. Alſo becauſe the devill beſought Chriſt not to torment him before the time. And becauſe both St <hi>Peter,</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. and St <hi>Iude,</hi> ver. 6. ſay, that they are as yet only reſerved in chains of darkneſſe, to the judgement of the great day.<note place="margin">Juſt.

Now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion cannot properly be applied to the aire, but rather aſcention. Therefore by Chriſts deſcending into hell, we may as I judge, ſafely underſtand, thoſe inward ſorrowes which he ſuffered in his agony in the garden, and on the croſſe, which preſſed him to cry ſo bitterly, <hi>my God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me:</hi> which internall ſorrowes, were as neer infernall ſorrowes, as the innocent ſurety of our ſalvation was capable; of which no mention was made in the Creed, but only by this Article: or that by the efficacy of his death he did pierce into hell, <hi>i.</hi> whereſoever the curſed ſpirits have their reſidence, deſpoiling them of their power, and confirm their damnation, and to ſignifie the deliverance of his people from their captivity.<note place="margin">Epheſ. 4.8.</note> And it ſeems to me that <hi>David</hi> intended this ſenſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.10. <hi>thou wilt not leave my ſoule in hell, i.</hi> in ſorrow and anguiſh; <hi>nor ſuffer my body to know corruption.</hi> All which ſhould work in us ſorrow for ſin, which put Chriſt to ſo much; and make us to deſcend in all humility under the hand of God, as he did, that with him we be exalted in due time. Alſo to ſhun de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpair, ſince God can bring us from the ſorrow of hell it ſelfe, as he did our bleſſed Saviour.</p>

Now this exaltation, conſiſteth, 1. In his Reſurrection. 2. In his aſcenſion. 3. In his ſeſſion at the right hand of God. 4. In the outward and inward adoration of the intellectuall and rationall creature. 5. In his comming to judge the world.</p>

                  <p>I know this outward geſture hath been much controverted. But when I conſider that God alloweth of outward viſible, as well as
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:37858:67"/>of the inviſible worſhip, and that St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, we muſt glorifie God in our bodies, as well as in our ſpirits: and that this poſture of bowing the knee, is founded upon the glory of God in Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.10. It may be practiſed by Chriſtians, yea,<note place="margin">Chryſoſt. <hi>ad popu.</hi> Antioch. <hi>hom.</hi> 61.</note> and ought to be at certain times of devotion, as a token of the ſame, and to teſtifie our ſubmiſſion to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whom God hath ſo highly exalted, and aſſigned him this worſhip as a part of his reward for ſuffering,<note place="margin">Theodo. <hi>in</hi> Phil. 2.</note> that by our humility he may be exalted, who was exalted for his humility, even to have him honoured in his name, when abſent, in reference to his perſon. I know that many objections are made againſt it. As firſt, that all things that are here ſpoken of, have not knees, as Angels below and above. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, nor have they tongues, therefore ſhall not they confeſſe him? The meaning then is, that all in their ſeverall manner ſhall willingly, or unwillingly be ſubject to Chriſt, whom God hath exalted by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſting him to be the eternall ſon of God. So that as we that have knees are to bowe them to the perſon that owns that name Jeſus, ſo ſhall all others do firſt or laſt willingly, or forcibly to the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and his power. For the bowing to the name as a word, or at the naming thereof alwaies, I do not underſtand the text intends it; but that Chriſtians in old time did uſe to uncover their heads at divine ſervice, when this name was pronounced, in ſigne that they did ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his deity,<note place="margin">Zanc. <hi>in</hi> Phil. <hi>c.</hi> 2.</note> againſt the blaſphemy of the Jewes and Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, who would not acknowledg his Godhead, is plainly to be found:<note place="margin">Hiero. <hi>in</hi> Iſa. 45.23.</note> and that they bowed the knee alſo, which the Jew in pride would not doe, which in time did degenerate to ſuperſtition. Yet ſure as it may be ſuperſtitiouſly uſed, ſo it may be irreligiouſly neglected, ſince that Chriſt hath ſaid, he that honoreth the Son, honoreth the Father, and that he will have all men worſhip the Son, as they worſhip the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and that God hath included his own name in <hi>Jeſus.</hi> I am,<note place="margin">Iſa. 43.11.</note> and beſide me there is no Saviour; and therefore being Jeſus the Savior, he muſt be Jehovah too, our righteouſneſſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6. Upon this ground I beleeve our Church hath injoined this geſture, as may be ſeen in the 52. injunction of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> and in the eighteenth Canon. But antiquity is antiquated, and the Church authority diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and ſo Gods worſhip diſanulled.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, ye are to know that only Chriſts body can properly be ſaid to riſe, becauſe that only died, although the ſoule and it were never diſunited from the perſon of the Son of God, though the ſoule was divided in death from the body: of which riſing there was teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony enough, both of Angels and men. The time of his riſing was the third day, neither ſooner nor later. And that firſt to fulfill both his type of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> who was taken alive from the altar the third day, after he was deſtined for death, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22.4. which receiving was in a figure, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.19. <hi>i.</hi> of Chriſts reſurrection; and alſo of that prophecie, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.2. the third day he will raiſe us, for by him we ſhall all be made alive, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.22. Againe, he roſe this day as it were to give a new
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:37858:68"/>beginning to the world. He died the day of the week that <hi>Adam</hi> was created, and roſe the firſt day of the week, on which God began the world, by which he enlightned Heaven and Earth, with the grace and joy of his reſurrection. Alſo he roſe with the ſun, to ſhew that he was the true Sun of righteouſneſſe that was to riſe with healing in his wings, <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.2. to enlighten the new Chriſtian world, after ſo long a night of dark legall ſhadowes, ſpoken of, <hi>Cant.</hi> 2.17. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.12. bringing life and immortality to light through the Goſpell,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.10.</note> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.10. The manner of his riſing was admirable: As firſt by his owne power, <hi>John</hi> 2.19. diſſolve this temple, meaning the temple of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and I will raiſe it up again the third day. So <hi>John</hi> 10.18. I have power to lay down my life, and I have power to take it up againe: this he did as he was God. He did it by himſelfe from the Father, through the eternall ſpirit. Again, he roſe by ſuch a way as never any man did before, namely, as the Prince of life, as the firſt born of the dead, as the firſt fruits of them that ſleep, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He never ſaw corruption, nor ever was to die any more, as <hi>Lazarus</hi> and others. He roſe in the ſame body that was buried, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.39. and in deſpight of his keeper, as the Church ſhall do in deſpight of all oppoſers; and with an earthquake, to ſhew how he will ſhake the world, firſt by the power of his word preached, and next by the power of his laſt comming to judgement.</p>

                  <p>Surely very many; as firſt, the confirmation of our faith in Chriſt, that he was the Son of God, becauſe he raiſed himſelfe from the dead, and that we are juſtified from our ſins, or elſe why is our ſurety let out of the priſon of his grave, but that Gods juſtice is fully ſatisfied, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4. and the laſt verſe. Again, it cauſeth a twofold reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in us; firſt from ſin to a new life of grace, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. Secondly, of our bodies from the grave, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.14. ſo it gives us an hope of heavenly inheritance, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3, 4. The reaſon whereof is, becauſe Chriſt ſuſtained our perſons in himſelfe, and ſo we have our part both in his death and reſurrection, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. Therefore this doctrine ought ever to be remembred, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8. not only in our head, but in our life, by ſtanding up from the dead, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.14. leſt if we have no part in the firſt reſurrection, we loſe alſo our part in the ſecond. And remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred it ought to be the rather, becauſe it may comfort againſt the moſt ſad afflictions,<note place="margin">Eſa. 26.19.</note> from whence Chriſt can raiſe us. So againſt the fear of Gods wrath, becauſe it is fully ſatisfied; from which baptiſm a type of the ark, and of our riſing with Chriſt above the deluge of Gods juſtice, doth now ſave us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.21. and againſt the power of death,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.11.</note> which by vertue hereof is ſo ſubdued, that it ſhall not alwaies ſuppreſſe us.</p>

So to ſhew that he fulfilled all things on earth, which concerned our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption and reconciliation; and therefore now aſcended in triumph,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:37858:68" rendition="simple:additions"/>leading captivity captive, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did the forces of the four Kings;<note place="margin">Pſal. 68.18.</note> and as <hi>Barack</hi> did the Midianites, and ſo enter into his glory prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.5. through the gates of heaven, intimated, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 24.7. and ſo demonſtrate, that Angels and principalities and powers, were made ſubject to him, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.22. Alſo that in Heaven he might make inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.24. who yet are in this world, as in the outward court of the moſt holy place, where the Jewes ſtood, when the High Prieſt entred to make an attonement for them, he being ſprinkled with blood, having the holy cenſer with ſweet incenſe in his hand, by which means he hath opened a way for us into heaven, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.10. as he had promiſed, and now performed it,<note place="margin">John 14.2, 3, Eph. 2.6.</note> by carrying our fleſh into heaven, as a pledge that we ſhould all follow that beleeve in him; alſo that we might place our mind, where our treaſure is, and not miſplace them on earthly things,<note place="margin">Col. 3.1.</note> nor to dream of his bodily preſence in this world, as if we would know him ſtill after the fleſh. This do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſts aſcenſion ſhould make us to forſake ſin and ſatan, &amp; not be ſubject to that ſlave which Chriſt hath led captive. So to be willing to die, that we may go to the place which Chriſt hath entred for us; and therefore not to mourn immoderately for the dead in Chriſt, who are ſeized of heaven already.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What is meant by Chriſts ſitting on Gods right hand; for I conceive not God to have either right or left hand, nor how Chriſt is tied to any ſuch poſture.</hi>

                  <p>You are to underſtand that ſitting ſo, importeth in Scripture, abiding or habitations, as <hi>Luke</hi> 24.49. ſometime judiciary power, as <hi>Solomon</hi> was ſaid to ſit on the throne of his Father, though he was not alwaies tied to that poſture, 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2.30. So by right hand is under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood power and help, and glory, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 44.3. Sometimes therefore as man is ſaid to be helped by Gods power, and protected when he ſtandeth on his right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 16.8. or holdeth by his right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23. So one is exalted, when one is ſaid to be on Chriſts right hand, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.29. which is ſpoken of the Church. So Chriſt by his ſitting, is underſtood to reſt in felicity from all his labor and pain, and on Gods right hand having dignity imperiall, and power judiciall; ſo that we are to underſtand by his ſitting on Gods right hand, that he doth not only reſt in joy and felicity, but hath obtained the higheſt dignity above all men and Angels, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.28. and that he is copartner with his father in his Kingdome, and therefore he hath power over all things in heaven and in earth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. not that God the Father ceaſeth to rule, but that he pleaſeth to adminiſter his Kingdome by his Son; yet he alſo makes Chriſts enemies his footſtool, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.1. till which time Chriſt muſt reign by and in the Kingdome of grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. but then he ſhall deliver up this Kingdome to God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>i.</hi> the rule which he exerciſeth now by Goſpell means, ſhal ceaſe when his enemies are ſubdued, and the elect fully gathered and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied: not that his Kingdome by which he is equall with God ſhall ceaſe, for of that his Kingdome ſhall be no end; but of that King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome by which he governeth by means and holy methods, of Word and Sacraments, and myſteries of godlineſſe. Now then, who can
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:37858:69"/>be aſhamed of Chriſts ſervice, who is ſo great a potentate, but rather to ſubmit to his government with all reverence and conſcience of his greatneſſe and power, that ſo we may ſhew our ſelves worthy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects and ſervants to him, leſt we cauſe that bleſſed name to be bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphemed, by which we are called. And who can chooſe but truſt in him for proviſion in all wants, and deliverance in all temptations of ſatan, or any adverſity, ſince our Saviour hath an univerſall power by ſitting at the right hand of God.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, for the confuſion of wicked men, who have mocked at it, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. whom he confutes in that chapter; firſt, of being igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant that the world was made by the Word of God, and that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied once by water, <hi>Gen.</hi> 7.11. in the 600. year of <hi>Noahs</hi> life, and that the world which is now, is reſerved for fire unto the day of judgement, and perdition of ungodly men foretold by <hi>Iſa.</hi> 66.15. <hi>Dan.</hi> 7.10. <hi>Mal.</hi> 4.1. and threatning a fire that ſhall conſume the wicked, both root and branch. Secondly, he ſhewes the reaſon why God de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferreth it; not that he is ſlack in his purpoſe, but becauſe he would not have them all to periſh by a ſudden ſurprize, but that Jew and Gentile might have a time to be called to ſalvation, and then it ſhall come ſuddenly as a thiefe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, there muſt be ſuch a day, becauſe judgement is not fully executed in this world; for oftentimes the beſt men are here oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, and the worſt are exalted; but a time muſt be, when God will reward every man according to his works. Judgement begins in this world with the houſe of God, but it will end with the wicked, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.17. So that this day will declare the juſtice of God, which now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth hidden, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.5. and is himſelfe cenſured by men, but then he ſhal overcome in judgement, which in part he hath ſhewed by the fiering of <hi>Sodom,</hi> and will compleat it by being revenged upon the ſins of all men, as well as theirs.</p>

                  <p>As ſome have thought it would never be, ſo others have been too bold to ſet the time, and ſo have made people careleſſe of their calling; and ſome ſeeing it did not come, to fall away from Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; of theſe St <hi>Paul</hi> warneth to take heed, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.1, 2, 3. and ſaith, that the Kingdome of Antichriſt muſt firſt come and be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied alſo, whereas it ſeemed ſome thought it would be in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles age, by miſtaking ſome Scriptures, as <hi>Iohn</hi> 21.21. that St <hi>Iohn</hi> ſhould tarry till Chriſt came. Others thought it would be 400. ſome 500. ſome 1000 years after Chriſts Aſcenſion. Others have thought 2000 years after Chriſts Nativity, becauſe they ſay the world was 2000 years before the Law, and 2000 under the Law, and 2000 years under the Goſpell, but for the elect ſake thoſe daies ſhall be ſhortned.
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:37858:69"/>But the account is falſe: for before the Law was more then 2000 years from the Creation, and leſſe then ſo under the Law: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore who can beleeve what they ſet down for the future. As for the ſhortning thoſe daies for the elects ſake, that is ſpoken of the troubles that fell upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Roman army in <hi>Veſpaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> their time. But that there ſhall be ſuch a day, the Scripture tels us, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.31. and God will have it known by preaching of it, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.42. both for the conſolation of his people in all their troubles, and to leave the wicked without excuſe, that they had no warning. And that this day ſhall be the laſt day of the laſt times, wherein men ſhall depart from the faith, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1. Which laſt times are not they ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.1, 2? for they were the laſt times of the fourth and laſt Monarchy foreſeen by <hi>Daniel,</hi> wherein the ſtone, <hi>i.</hi> Chriſt, ſhould cruſh to duſt all thoſe Monarchies, and ſet a Goſpell Kingdome. But theſe laſt times are the latter times of the Goſpell profeſſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in men ſhall give heed to ſpirits of error, and doctrines of devils; ſuch as popiſh heatheniſme in worſhipping Images, Saints, and Angels, which is nothing elſe but the renewing of their old ſuperſtitions, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the colour of Chriſtian Religion. But it may be that ſome may wonder why God ſhould defer the day of Judgement, ſo long after the death of ſo many faithfull Patriarchs and Prophets, and holy Martyrs. But they conſider not that God hath reſpect to his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, in raiſing and altering things in the world, as the Monarchies there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, and the riſing and fall of Antichriſt; the rejection and calling of the Jewes; the full comming in of the Gentiles to Goſpell profeſſion; the gathering of the elect by the means of Goſpell-preaching, who muſt have a time to be born and live, and hear inſtruction, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the works of righteouſneſſe. Nor do they conſider that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring thereof is for the triall of the elects faith, patience, and devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in prayer, like the Saints crying under the Altar, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.10. How long, Lord, holy and true, doſt thou defer thy judgement? Others it may be will object, that ſeeing that God hath determined this day, why will he hide it from us? The reaſon is no doubt, becauſe he would have us watch, and be prepared like the wiſe virgins with oile in our lamps, and like him that expects a theefe to come ſuddenly, as Chriſt tels us, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.43. But ſome will ſay, it is no wonder that we know it not, being that Chriſt himſelfe ſaith he knew it not, <hi>Mark</hi> 13.32. To which it may be anſwered, that he knew it not, ſo as to make us to know it; as God is ſaid to prove <hi>Iſrael</hi> that he may know; that is, that he may make them to know, <hi>Deut.</hi> 13.3. for God knew before what they would do; or that he knew it not as he was man in the eſtate of his humiliation; or that he knew it not without revelation from his divinity, but now he is glorified, he as man knoweth the day and hour. But it may be ſome will be ſo curious to ask, where ſhall this judgement be? Some think in the vallie of <hi>Iehoſophat,</hi> from <hi>Ioel</hi> 3.2. but that place hath only relation to thoſe nations that afflicted <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſo is but an alluſion to this great aſſizes at the judgement day: yet it is probable that Chriſt may judge where he was judged; but we have no certaine proofe from Scripture where it ſhall be, but
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:37858:70"/>that he will come in the clouds, and every eie ſhall ſee him, and thoſe that have pierced him, and thither the elect ſhal be caught up to meet him; 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.17. even in the aire, where the devill now ruleth, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.2. as a Prince, but ſhall then be judged with the reſt of his crue to hell, to which place they are not as yet committed.</p>

                     </note> few or none oppoſing it more openly than good <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> excepting the Councill of <hi>Nice.</hi> The next ſign is the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Antichriſt, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.4. by Gods witneſſes, namely, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, or ſome faithfull expounders thereof.

                  <p>He took away from them Scepter and Myter, Kingſhip and Prieſthood, and the very face of a Commonwealth, about forty years after Chriſts death, by <hi>Vespaſian</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> with their Roman army, as was foretold by <hi>Daniel.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Dan 9.26, 27.</note> The occaſion whereof was, they having been conquered by the Romans, and governed by their Deputies, and they carrying an hard hand upon them, they rebelled, as <hi>Florus,</hi> (who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded after <hi>Faelix, Feſtus,</hi> and <hi>Albinus</hi>) was ſo avaritious, that he took out of the treaſury of the Temple, ſixteen talents of ſilver, and when the Jewes murmured at it, he permitted the ſouldiers to ſlay and ſpoil the Citizens of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at pleaſure, and ſcourged and crucified Jews of noble birth. Here their refuſing Chriſt, and chuſing <hi>Barabbas</hi> a murtherer, began to be revenged, and the ſcourging and crucifying Chriſt, to be retaliated, and his blood to fall upon their children. This was the ground of that war, that ruined <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at laſt.</p>
                  <p>But not only this was the cauſe, but God gave them up to an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate mind, for their malice againſt Chriſt, and the prophecie began to take upon them,<note place="margin">Zac. 11.9.</note> which <hi>Zachariah</hi> foretold; <hi>I will not feed you, that which dieth, let it die, and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off, and let the reſt eat the fleſh of each other.</hi>

                  <p>Againe, to haſten their ruine, <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> ſucceeding <hi>Tiberius,</hi> would have his image ſet up in the Jewes Temple, which though the Jewes zealous of their Religion, would rather die then ſuffer, yet it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited the Emperors malice the more; which though it was unjuſt in him, yet was it juſt with God to make him an inſtrument to puniſh them who were more afraid to defile their Temple of ſtone, then to deſtroy the body of Chriſt in whom dwelt the fulneſſe of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily.</p>
                  <p>After him ſucceeded <hi>Claudius,</hi> in whoſe time 20000. of them were ſlain by crouding and treading one another in narrow places, for fear of <hi>Cumanus</hi> ſouldiers, who came but to keep the peace, becauſe they began to murmure much, and the inſolencie of a ſouldier, which ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his privities in the porch of the Temple.</p>

                     <hi>Vespaſian</hi> with his ſon <hi>Titus,</hi> with an army of 60000. having firſt ſubdued many of the Jewes rebellious Towns, at laſt gave order to beſiege <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which he left to his ſon <hi>Titus</hi> to ſubdue, and himſelfe returned to <hi>Rome.

At laſt the City was taken, and the Temple ruined: the people, ſome crucified, others ript up in hope to find gold in their bellies; others ſold as ſlaves for thirty a penny, as they valued Chriſt but at thirty pence; others carried captive, and devoured by wild beaſts, at the triumphs of <hi>Veſpaſian.</hi> Thus God rewarded them, that regarded not his Son, ſo that deſtruction came on them to the uttermoſt; for ſince that time they never had the face of a Church nor State, but are ſcattered, and hated of all nations. And in token that their Religion ſhould not riſe again, their Temple could never be rebuilt (though much endeavoured) no more than <hi>Apollos</hi> Temple at <hi>Delphos</hi> could, which after this was deſtroied by thunder and earthquakes,<note place="margin">Theo. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 11.</note> as if God meant to put an end to Judaiſme, and to Heatheniſme, and to ſet up Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity.

Theſe latter proſelytes received the Goſpell with great joy: and of theſe converts Chriſt built his New Teſtaments Church, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his Apoſtles through preaching, which he confirmed by ſigns and wonders:<note place="margin">Acts 15.10.</note> For when it was queſtioned, whether the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles that beleeved (or ſhould beleeve) ſhould conform to circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or not; it was concluded by St <hi>Peter,</hi> that no ſuch burden ſhould be laid upon them,<note place="margin">Acts 10.28.</note> becauſe he had received no ſuch order from God in his viſion at <hi>Ioppa,</hi> from whence he was immediately ſent to <hi>Corne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius,</hi> an uncircumciſed proſelyte, between whom and Jewes, God put no difference, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. but purified their hearts by faith, and gave them alſo the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.8, 9. to whom alſo St <hi>Iames</hi> aſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.19.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Acts 1.15, 26.</note> When they had thus filled up the number of the twelve Apoſtles, their next meeting was upon the day of Pentecoſt, a Feaſt of the Jewes,<note place="margin">Levit. 23.11, 15.</note> called a Feaſt of weeks, or fifty daies begun on the ſixteenth day of <hi>Niſan,</hi> or the ſecond of the Paſſeover, or the morrow after the Feaſt of the Paſſeover, which was the fifteenth, as the killing of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over was on the fourteenth of the ſame month at even. On this ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth day they were to offer a ſheafe of their firſt corn, and the Prieſt was to wave or ſhake it before the Lord. Upon which day Chriſt the firſt fruits of the dead roſe out of the grave with an earthquake.

So Chriſt having compleated the harveſt of mans redemption, and preſented himſelfe in both natures, divine and humane, to God as interceſſor, he ſent upon his Apoſtles the holy Ghoſt with plenty of celeſtiall gifts, to feed and ſuſtain his Church. In reſpect of which candid gifts of ſight, it was ſtiled rightly Whitſunday, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians were clothed in white garments.</p>
                  <p>Their next aſſociation was in the Temple at praier time, and at breaking of bread in their houſes, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. that is, in their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate oratories, or upper rooms ſet apart for holy occaſions, of which there was no uſe when Churches were built, except for devotion of the private family.

Another meeting you find, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.2. about chooſing the ſeven Deacons, of whom <hi>Stephen</hi> was one, who was the firſt Martyr that ſuffered death for Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.58. Then began perſecution to wax hot, by reaſon of <hi>Sauls</hi> being too zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Law of <hi>Moſes, Acts</hi> 8.4. and ſo the Church was ſcattered;
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:37858:74"/>but he was converted, <hi>Acts</hi> 9. Then had the Church reſt, and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplied exceedingly, <hi>ver.</hi> 31. and ſpread very farre, and at <hi>Antioch</hi> they were firſt called Chriſtians, <hi>Acts</hi> 11.26.

The priſons were ſo full of them, there was hardly room for malefactors. Women were hung up in trees by one leg. Some rent by bowed trees, ſome tortured many daies, ſinging Pſalms joifully.

                  <p>You muſt know that before the reign of <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> moſt of the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> were Martyrs or Confeſſors, to the number of thirty, from <hi>Linus</hi> the firſt Biſhop, who began to govern the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> after <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> had ſuffered. But after the reign of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantine</hi> and his ſons, the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> grew in higher eſteem more and more. Firſt in being made Patriarchs, together with the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops of <hi>Alexandria</hi> and <hi>Antiochia,</hi> by the generall Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> for the timely ſuppreſſing of hereſies: But he got the ſtart of them all, and was accepted as the prime Biſhop, both in regard of the anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity of his See, and alſo becauſe his ſeat was in the moſt ancient im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periall City, <hi>Rome.</hi> But he began to encroach and uſurp authority exceedingly, as others did who ſucceeded him. But when I ſay ſuch an one ſucceeded next, I mean not alwaies the next in perſon, but in regard of his office, though ſome came between: for my intent is not to make an abſolute direct chronology or catalogue of them, but to ſhew which of them was moſt active in advancing Antichriſtian Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauny; though here and there ſome of them were of better conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Therefore as Pope <hi>Zepherinus</hi> before the Emperour <hi>Conſtantine,</hi>

                     </note> would have no Biſhop condemned till his cauſe was heard by the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> So afterward <hi>Innocentius</hi> the firſt, the predeceſſor to <hi>Zozimus,</hi> writ to the Councill of <hi>Carthage,</hi> that no Decree could be firm, till allowed by the Chair of <hi>Rome;</hi> whom <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi> followed, and urged ſubmiſſion of the Church of <hi>Carthage</hi> to the Chair of <hi>Rome;</hi> and therefore they ſhould receive <hi>Appiarius,</hi> whom they had excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated, for appealing from his own Biſhop to the Biſhop of <hi>Rome;</hi> but they regarded him not.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faelix</hi> the third, did alſo excommunicate <hi>Acacius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> becauſe he abſolved <hi>Petrus Moggux</hi> the <hi>Eutychian</hi> heretick, without his leave; upon which <hi>Acacius</hi> did as much for him.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Gelaſius</hi> his ſucceſſor was more peremptory:<note place="margin">Gelaſius.</note> for he plainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the Judge of all Churches, but be judged by none; nor would be reconciled to the Eaſtern Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, except they would excommunicate <hi>Acacius,</hi> and raze his name out of the catalogue of Biſhops. He alſo made bold to excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the Emperour <hi>Anaſtaſius,</hi> for favouring the <hi>Eutychian</hi> hereſie; which example was by his ſucceſſors put in execution upon Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors without being hereticks.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Faelix</hi> the fourth excommunicated alſo <hi>Athanaſius</hi> Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople</hi> for hereſie.

<pb n="134" facs="tcp:37858:82"/>the Emperour, and his fifth generall Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> though he came in not by the door, but by means of <hi>Theodora,</hi> a wicked Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe, who had cauſed <hi>Silverius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> to be baniſhed, who ſucceeded <hi>Boniface</hi> the ſecond, and placed <hi>Vigilius</hi> for bribes and baſe promiſes, in his Chaire.</p>

                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> the firſt, that ſucceeded <hi>Vigilius,</hi> was more crafty then pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remptory: for though he was vexed at <hi>Honoratus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Millain,</hi> becauſe he ordained <hi>Paulinus</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Macedonius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leia,</hi> without his leave; yet he put it as a contempt of the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian</hi> in his relation of it to <hi>Narſes,</hi> the Emperours generall, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping to creep into ſovereignty the more ſecurely, under colour of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the Civill Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>John</hi> the third, and <hi>Benedict</hi> the firſt, did not ſtickle much, becauſe the Lombards at that time much oppreſſed <hi>Italy.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pelagius</hi> the ſecond, was elected without the knowledge of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour: but that was excuſed by the Popes Embaſſadour, <hi>Gregory,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Rome</hi> was ſo ſtrictly beſieged, that no meſſenger could be ſent unto him.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, ſucceeded <hi>Pelagius,</hi> by the choice of the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy and people of <hi>Rome:</hi> he ſeemed unwilling to accept it, and wrote letters to the Emperour to refuſe their choice; which were intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and other letters ſent to deſire the Emperours condeſcenſion. He firſt ſet up the ſtile that the Popes uſe ſtill in their title (the ſervant of the ſervants of God) in oppoſition to <hi>John</hi> the foſter-Patriarch of <hi>Constantinople,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Servus ſervo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum Dei.</note> who uſurped the ſtile of univerſall Biſhop, and called him the forerunner of Antichriſt; yet he baſely flattered <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour in his Epiſtles, who had murthered his Lord <hi>Mauritius,</hi> his wife and children.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Gregory</hi> forbad ſpirituall men to marry;<note place="margin">Marriage for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden to the Clergy.</note> but was forced to recall it, becauſe of their fornication and murthering of young infants ſo begotten. But though this Pope did declaime againſt the title of univerſall Biſhop, and <hi>Fabianus</hi> his ſucceſſor did not claim it, yet his next ſucceſſor, <hi>Boniface</hi> the third, did obtain it of <hi>Phocas,</hi> by abſolving him the murther of <hi>Mauritius,</hi> namely, to be Biſhop of Biſhops; and that the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the head of all Churches.</p>
                  <p>After him came <hi>Boniface</hi> the fourth, obtained of <hi>Phocas</hi> the heathen Temple called <hi>Pantheon,</hi> becauſe it was built to the honour of all the heathen gods, and dedicated it to all Saints, and appointed an holiday to be kept in their honour: ſo Idolatry crept in, which afterward was the cauſe of much perſecution; for he took it from the heathen gods, and by it made gods of the Saints.</p>

                     <hi>Theodalus</hi> ſucceeds him, and brings in Antichriſt by an Ordinance, that none ſhould marry that woman that had been witneſſe with him at Baptiſme, which was never forbidden by Gods Law or Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>

Therefore after <hi>Sylve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter</hi> the ſecond, and divers other Popes, <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth called a Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who denied tranſubſtantiation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the ſecond followed, who forced by a Councill <hi>Berengari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi> to recant, who did, yet afterward wrote againſt tranſubſtantiation. He was poiſoned as other Popes before him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſecond followed, who denied to rule as Pope with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Emperours conſent. For which he was beaten in a chamber by <hi>Hildebrand</hi> in his pontificials, and caſt into priſon, where he died.

                     </note> This was brought to paſſe by the thunder of excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which made the Emperour, <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, travell to <hi>Rome</hi> in the hard winter, to get abſolution from the Popes curſe.</p>

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rbanus</hi> the ſecond excited Princes to war againſt the Turks, who had got <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> This he did in a Councill held at <hi>Cleremount</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> and by divers Princes recovered it for a while. But this war made Chriſtian Princes ſo weak both in power and purſe, that the Pope more eaſily brought them all under his girdle.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paſchalis</hi> the ſecond ſucceeds him, who at the Church of <hi>Lateran</hi> had a ſcepter put into his hand, and girded with a girdle, having ſeven ſeals and keies hanging at it, ſignifying his power of binding and loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; ſhutting and opening; ſealing and reſigning, and judging. He excommunicated <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, the Emperour, and excites his ſon <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth againſt him. He took up the corps of <hi>Henry</hi> the fourth, and kept it above ground five yeers. Well did the Biſhop of <hi>Florence</hi> write in this Popes time, that Antichriſt was born, and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to the world; and therefore he was ſilenced by the Councill of <hi>Florence</hi> which this Pope called, and his book burnt. You ſee how perſecutions began now upon Emperours and Biſhops. This Pope would not crown <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth Emperour, unleſſe he would give over his right of inveſtment of Biſhops by the ſtaffe and ring; but the Emperor laid hold of him and his Cardinals, and compelled him to do it; and the Pope ſolemnly divided the holy Hoſt between him and the Emperour, and wiſhed that he might be divided from the Kingdom of Chriſt, that broke the covenant made between himſelfe and the Emperour: yet afterward he recalled all that he done, and cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Emperour, who was fain to reſign his priviledge for peace ſake.</p>
                  <p>Next ſucceeded <hi>Gelaſius</hi> the ſecond, without the Emperours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, <hi>Henry</hi> the fifth.</p>
                  <p>Then followed <hi>Calixtus</hi> the ſecond, who compelled the Emperour to yield to his election; and ordained that the people ſhould not put away any of their Biſhops for their life time.</p>
                  <p>Then followed Pope <hi>Honorius</hi> the ſecond, in whoſe time one <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulphus</hi> came to <hi>Rome,</hi> and preached againſt the Clergies errors, pride and avarices, for which they ſecretly drowned him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third ſucceeds. In his time the people grew weary of the Popes Tyranny, reſolved to be governed by conſuls. This Pope therefore made an ordinance, that whoever laid violent hands upon any of the Clergy, he ſhould be excommunicated, and not abſolved by any man but the Pope only.</p>
                  <p>And alſo Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> by curſings and force, brought all the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators of <hi>Rome</hi> under ſubjection to himſelfe, and to receive ſuch into their ſociety as he thought fit.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>The chiefe of theſe was one <hi>Waldus</hi> a Merchant of <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> who ſeeing one of his company in their walking fall down dead, he laied it ſo to heart, that he repented earneſtly of his former life, and became very charitable to the poor, and ſtudious of the Scriptures; and alſo to inſtruct his own family and others that came to him in thoſe tenets which the Proteſtants afterward held, and hold ſtill.

<pb n="142" facs="tcp:37858:89"/>again, but reſtored to him nothing but the title of a Roman Senator. He excommunicated <hi>Peter</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon,</hi> for laying claim to the Kingdome of <hi>Sicily,</hi> to which <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the third his predeceſſor had perſwaded him.</p>
                  <p>

                     <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the fourth ſucceeds, after whoſe death the Popedome was void two yeers and a quarter, by reaſon of the Cardinals diſſentions about it.

He brought back poor <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi> from the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to which he had retired himſelfe, and impriſoned him till he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of griefe. He came to the Popedome like a Fox, but he lived like a Lion: for he perſecuted thoſe that took part with the Emperour <hi>Frederick,</hi> called Gibbelines, even Cardinals themſelves.

In celebration whereof, the firſt day he ſhewed himſelfe in his Biſhops robes with St <hi>Peters</hi> keies. The next day in Kingly apparel, with a naked ſword borne before him, one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claiming, Behold the power of both ſwords, <hi>i.</hi> Civil and Eccleſiaſtick.

                  </p>
                  <p>After him <hi>Clement</hi> the fifth excommunicated the Emperor <hi>Andron.

Alſo he ordained that the King of the Romans ſhould not have the title of Emperour without the Popes confirmation. He removed his Court from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>

                  <p>Next followed <hi>John</hi> the 23. after the Popedome had been void two years and more. He was exceeding covetous, and proclaimed them Hereticks, who ſaid that in this world Chriſt and his Apoſtles had no poſſeſſions. He would not yeeld to the Coronation of <hi>Lewis</hi> the fifth, Emperour, becauſe he exerciſed his authority in <hi>Italy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was confirmed by the Pope. But <hi>Lewis</hi> took his journie to <hi>Rome,</hi> and was crowned by the Cardinals; and then he ſet up <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the fifth to be Pope, and ſo then <hi>Rome</hi> had two heads.</p>

                     <hi>Clement</hi> the ſixt reduced the Jubilee ordained to be kept every hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dredth year to the fift year. He by his Buls commanded Angels to convey their ſouls to Paradiſe that died by the way, when they went to war for the Holy land, and gave power to all that were ſigned with the croſſe, to deliver three or four whom they would, out of Purgatory; which deliverance muſt be beleeved rather then acted.</p>
                  <p>Next followed <hi>Innocentius</hi> the ſixt. He impriſoned Frier <hi>John,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">John de rupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciſſa.</note> for that he prophecied of the fall of the Pope and Cardinals, who were like a bird in borrowed feathers.

                  <p>Next followed <hi>Gregory</hi> the eleventh, who removed the Popes Court from <hi>Avignion</hi> to <hi>Rome</hi> again, after it had been there about ſeventy yeers.</p>
                  <p>After his death there fell a great ſchiſme among the Cardinals. They of <hi>Italy</hi> choſe <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſixt, and they of <hi>France</hi> choſe <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh.

                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the ſixt his time, <hi>John Wickliffe</hi> appeared in England; who by his writings diſplaied Antichriſt in many parts of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and much ſhook the Popes Kingdome in <hi>England, Bohemia,</hi> and <hi>Moravia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Next was <hi>Boniface</hi> the ninth; who ſold pardons, as if he had bought the keies which he made to be deſpiſed.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Innocentius</hi> the ſeventh ſucceeded him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the twelfth is choſen next by the Cardinals, and ſworn to endevour to reſtore the Church <hi>Rome</hi> to unity. But he and <hi>Benedict</hi> the thirteenth at <hi>Avignion,</hi> agreed to divide. The Cardinals got a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Councill at <hi>Piſa,</hi> and depoſed them both, and choſe <hi>Alexander</hi> the fift, who was ſo liberall, that he gave almoſt all away from him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, ſaying, that he was a rich Biſhop, a poor Cardinall, and a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly Pope.</p>
                  <p>Next followed <hi>John</hi> the twenty fourth, the other two depoſed Popes being yet alive, and executed juriſdiction, becauſe the Councill of <hi>Piſa</hi> was not lawfully called. Now the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> looked like a <hi>Cerberus,</hi> hels bandog with three heads. The Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> found no remedy to make up this rent, but by calling a Councill at <hi>Conſtance,</hi> where all three Popes were depoſed, and <hi>Martin</hi> the fifth choſen: for joy whereof, the Emperour kiſſed his feet. At this time earneſt ſuits were made for reformation of the Clergy, and againſt ſuperſtitious Feaſts and Faſts, and canonizing Saints; and againſt the multiplication of <hi>Monks.</hi> Fair promiſes were made by the Pope to convocate a Councill: but little was done to his death.</p>
                  <p>This Councill burnt <hi>John Huſs, Jerome</hi> of <hi>Prague,</hi> and <hi>John Wickliffs</hi> bones.</p>
                  <p>Next followed <hi>Eugenius</hi> the fourth, who for his contumacy was
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:37858:90"/>depoſed by the Councill of <hi>Baſil,</hi> who placed <hi>Faelix</hi> the fifth in his room. But after <hi>Sigiſmunds</hi> death, <hi>Eugenius</hi> goeth on, and ſtirs up wars by the <hi>French</hi> to invade <hi>Baſil,</hi> and to break up the Councill; and alſo <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>diſlaus</hi> King of <hi>Polonia,</hi> to war upon the Turks, contrary to his cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant made with <hi>Amurath</hi> their King; to which purpoſe he gave him a full diſpenſation to break his oath: but he was ſlain, and his Army ſpoiled by the Turks.</p>
                  <p>Next was <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the fift, and ruled eight years: to whom <hi>Faelix</hi> the fift, who was elected in the Councill of <hi>Baſil,</hi> was content to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit himſelfe, and he only a Cardinall.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Calixtus</hi> the third followed <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the fift, who not prevailing with Chriſtian Princes to make war upon the Turk; yet he ſtirred up the King of <hi>Perſia</hi> to do it, and ſo diverted the Turke from <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Pius</hi> the ſecond followed, called before <hi>Aeneas Sylvius.</hi> He mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Chriſtian Princes againſt the Turks alſo; but they were at wars among themſelves, and ſo could not anſwer his deſire. He miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liked the inhibition of Prieſts marriages, and thought fit it were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Paulus</hi> the ſecond ſucceeds him. He was as unlearned, as <hi>Pius</hi> was learned. He (like ſome ſchiſmaticks now) accounted humane lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hereſie: and ſo they may ſee their error is popiſh, while they condemn learning as if it were popery.</p>
                  <p>Next comes <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, <hi>Innocentius</hi> the eight, <hi>Alexander</hi> the ſixt, who impriſoned and baniſhed many Cardinals.</p>
                  <p>Then followed <hi>Pius</hi> the third, and next <hi>Julius</hi> the ſecond, who by the Emperour <hi>Maximilian,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> and <hi>France's</hi> aids, ſpoiled the <hi>Venetians</hi> of many territories, yet he received them again into favor, and ſo diſcontented the Emperour and the King of <hi>France,</hi> that they thought to depoſe him by their Councill at <hi>Piſa.</hi> But he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led another Councill at <hi>Rome,</hi> which diſanulled all they did at <hi>Piſa.</hi> He lived in wars all his time.</p>

He curſed King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth of <hi>England</hi> therefore, and interdicted the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; ratified the order of Jeſuites, and called a Councill at <hi>Trent,</hi> where the Proteſtants would not appear, becauſe they ſaid that Councill was not lawfully called, and the Pope ſate Judge, who was the party they were to accuſe of errors, and abuſing the Church. He carried the Councill to <hi>Bononia.</hi>

                     <hi>Paulus</hi> the fourth followed, who hated <hi>Charls</hi> the Emperour, who reſigned his government to his ſon <hi>Ferdinand,</hi> and died in a Monaſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The Pope approved not this election; but <hi>Ferdinand</hi> eſteemed not of his approbation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Pius</hi> the fourth followed. In his time the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> called by <hi>Paul</hi> the third, was diſſolved, which had ſate ſix yeers only of eighteen. But before that, he ſent an Embaſſador into <hi>England</hi> to invite the Clergy to that Councill, but Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> would not ſuffer him to land. Nor would the Germans ſend any. <hi>Scotland</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo revolted from popery. He maſſacred Proteſtants at <hi>Montalto</hi> in Italy, to the number of eighty, becauſe they met at an houſe to hear a Sermon.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Pius</hi> the fifth followed, who with the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and the King of <hi>Spain</hi> and his own aids, overcame the Turks at <hi>Lepanto,</hi> under the conduct of <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Auſtria.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth followed. He founded a new Colledge for Jeſuites, and gave it great revenues to bring up ſchollers to convert the <hi>Germans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Guiſes</hi> faction, and the Queen Mother, made an horrid maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cre in <hi>Paris</hi> of the Proteſtants, whom they called Huguenots, 1572.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Manicheus</hi> opinions were, that there were two beginnings; one evil, and the other good; which is all one as to ſay there be two Gods.

                  <p>We find ſome holding God to be like a man, becauſe <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.21.

                  <p>Then followed the <hi>Meſſalians,</hi> called <hi>Euchitae,</hi> becauſe they thought the whole duty of man conſiſted in praiers, not hearing, by which St <hi>Paul</hi> tels us, that faith is begotten, by which praier muſt be offered up.

                  <p>One <hi>Godeſcalcus</hi> a Dutch man, ſaid, that by predeſtination men were forced both to do good and evill.</p>
                  <p>About 1100. yeers after Chriſt, a kind of monomachy aroſe between the Greek and Latine Churches, about the bread in the Sacrament; whether it ſhould be leavened or unleavened. The Greek Church was called <hi>Fermentarii;</hi> the Latine <hi>Azymitae:</hi> the firſt did leven it, the other did not.</p>
                  <p>After this, one <hi>Petrus Abolandus</hi> a <hi>French</hi> man, ſaid, the Holy Ghoſt was the ſoul of the world, and not of the ſubſtance of God the Father.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Almericus</hi> alſo of <hi>France,</hi> ſaid, that God was the eſſence of all crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and that they all ſhould be converted into God again.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Paleneni</hi> about <hi>Tholouze</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> affirmed that a man might attain to ſuch perfection in this world, that he might be void of all ſin; and that ſuch were not ſubject to any Civill or Eccleſiaſtick pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that they had no need of praier and faſting, or any exerciſe whereby grace may be increaſed. Theſe laid ſome grounds upon which the Anabaptiſts build now.</p>
                  <p>Others under a colour of Religion and charity, made all things common, and women alſo; Theſe ſurely began the Family of Love. About 1600. years after Chriſt, ſprang up the Anabapriſts: but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to ſpeak of them, and others following from their time, I muſt tell you according to your queſtion, how and when the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants came in, and how perſecuted by Papiſts, and oppoſed by here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticks and ſchiſmaticks.</p>

                  <p>You muſt take notice that the Proteſtant Religion hath been maintained in her doctrine from the beginning of the Primitive times. Firſt, by the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> themſelves, for the firſt 300. years after Chriſt: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="100"/> and many of them were Confeſſors and Martyrs, though their pride began to appear 100. years before, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="200"/> in <hi>Zepherinus,</hi> and other Biſhops following him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="300"/> as hath been declared before. But after that they were grown rich and potent by the favour of Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours; and got themſelves choſen (without the Emperours conſent) by the votes of the Clergy and people of <hi>Rome;</hi> and that <hi>Boniface</hi> the third had got the title of univerſall <hi>Biſhop,</hi> they began to break out into ſtrange opinions and manners; as that the Chair of <hi>Rome</hi> was infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, as you ſee in Pope <hi>Agatho</hi> his decree, and excommunicating Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours, and ſuffering them to kiſſe his feet; as did Pope <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the firſt, and others. Condemning Prieſts marriage, and ſetting up the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:37858:93"/>the ſervice of the Church in Latine, as did <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the firſt: and that whatſoever the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> appointed, ſhould be perpetually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, as did <hi>Stephanus</hi> the fifth: and ſetting up the Maſſe, Purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, Pilgrimages, adoration of images, invocation of Saints, and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation: and ſetting themſelves above generall Councils in determinations of faith; ſo that no decree or Canon could paſſe with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Popes approbation. They getting thus aloft, ſuppreſſed all that withſtood their tenets. From hence it came that the true Religion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came eclipſed; yet ſome God raiſed up in every age, who wrote againſt both their pride and errors; though by reaſon of the over ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling power of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> they could not ſo plainly appear, as in the time of <hi>Luther,</hi> and afterwards.</p>

                  <p>About this time ſprung up <hi>Waldus;</hi> of whom you have heard formerly. His opinions be theſe following.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Scriptures are only to be beleeved in matters of faith, and contain all things neceſſary for faith and manners.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That Chriſt is the only Mediator, and that Saints are not to be invoked.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. He held traditions not neceſſary to ſalvation; and denied Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and Maſſes ſung for the dead.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That conſtrained faſt daies, and making difference of meats; ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous holy daies; variety of ſuperſtitious orders of Prieſts and Monks, Friers and Nuns, hallowing of creatures; vowes, and alſo pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grims, and humane ceremonies, were to be aboliſhed; and that no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees ſhould be received into the Church, but Biſhops, Prieſts and Deacons.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. They denied the Popes ſupremacy over other Churches, States, and Governments.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> is ſpiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Pope An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt; and rejected the Popes pardons, and allowed the marriages of Prieſts.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. And that they that hear the true word of God, and beleeve it, are the true Church.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. And that the Communion was to be eaten, and not reſerved for ſhew or worſhip. For which opinions they endured perſecutions of Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, who excited all Chriſtian Princes to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute them with fire and ſword: all which the Proteſtants hold, for which they alſo have been perſecuted; as ſhall appear.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Hildebertus</hi> alſo abhorred the pride of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſaid, that <hi>Rome</hi> if it had no Rulers, or at leaſt ſuch as did not violate the faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Bernard,</hi> Abbot of <hi>Claravell,</hi> held free juſtification by Chriſts me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and thought that all Chriſtian people had conſpired againſt Chriſt, and that thoſe were the chiefe perſecutors that had the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt places in the Church. So thought Proteſtants.
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:37858:94"/>
                     <hi>Nichetes</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Nicomedia,</hi> held againſt <hi>Anſelmus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Havel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burgh,</hi> that the Pope was not the principall Biſhop; and that the power of binding and looſing was not given to <hi>Peter,</hi> but alſo to all the reſt of the Apoſtles even as they all received graces alike, on the day of Pentecoſt, <hi>Act</hi> 2. So hold the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>About 1300. yeers after Chriſt,<note place="margin">1300.</note> true Religion began to be much darkened by ſchoole diſputations, by many that followed ſchool diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putations, and <hi>Peter Lombards</hi> Sentences: as <hi>Albertus Magnus, Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas, Alexander de Ales,</hi> and <hi>Scotus</hi> called <hi>Dunce,</hi> of the Town in <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> where he was born; but of a moſt ſubtile wit.</p>
                  <p>But God ſtill ſtirred up ſome to maintain the cauſe of his truth. As <hi>Arnoldus de nova villa</hi> a Spaniard, who held in his time,</p>
                  <p>That the devill had ſeduced the world from the truth of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That the faith then commonly taught, was the faith of devils.</p>
                  <p>That Chriſtian people were led by the Pope to hell.</p>
                  <p>That the Cloiſters had no charity, and falſified the doctrine of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>That the Miniſters did not well to mix Philoſophy with Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity.</p>
                  <p>That maſſes are not to be celebrated, nor that Prieſts ought to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice for the dead. All which the Proteſtants hold.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Gulielmus de Sancto Amore,</hi> a Maſter of the Univerſity of <hi>Paris,</hi> appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the texts of Scripture that make againſt Antichriſt, to the Pope and his Clergy; and proved the Friers to be falſe Prophets, and writ againſt their wilfull poverty, ſhewing that Chriſt when he ſaid, <hi>Mat.</hi> 19.21. <hi>Go and ſell all thou haſt, and give it to the poor,</hi> did not intend a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall, but habituall poverty; namely, that we ſhould not impove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh our ſelves when no need requireth, but that in our affections we ſhould be ready ſo to do, when the confeſſion of Chriſt and his glory ſhall require it, that then we be ready to leave all for his ſake. So ſay the Proteſtants alſo.</p>
                  <p>But this man was condemned for an heretick, and exiled, and his books burnt.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Laurence</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> man, and a Maſter of <hi>Paris,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1300.</note> and <hi>Peter John</hi> a Minorite, and <hi>Robertus Gallus</hi> a Dominican Frier, wrote, that the Pope was Antichriſt, and <hi>Rome</hi> was great <hi>Babylon,</hi> and that the Pope was an Idoll that had eies, but would not ſee the abominations of his Church for deſire of riches. So the Proteſtants hold likewiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Robert Goſtred</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> would not admit at the Popes command, for an <hi>Italian</hi> boy to be one of the Prebends of his Church, but writ to him that it was a deviliſh ſin to defraud the people of the preaching of the Word, by ſetting thoſe in place that could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form the Miniſteriall office, but only take the milke and wooll of Chriſts ſheep. He prophecied in his ſickneſſe, that the Church ſhould not be delivered from <hi>Romes</hi> Aegyptian bondage, but by a bloody ſword. So think the Proteſtants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Marſilius Patavinus</hi> affirmed, that the Pope had not authority over other Biſhops, much leſſe over the Emperour;<note place="margin">

So hold the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants alſo.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Michael Ceſenas,</hi> Provinciall of the Grey Friers, writ againſt the Popes pride and ſupremacy, and cals him Antichriſt, and <hi>Rome Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the great whore drunk with the blood of the Saints: that there were two Churches, one of the wicked very flouriſhing, wherein the Pope reigned; the other of godly men afflicted, over whom Chriſt reigned.

Some report of this good Martyr, that though they burnt the Gooſe (for ſo <hi>Huſs</hi> ſignifieth) yet out of his aſhes ſhould riſe a Swan (ſo <hi>Luther ſignifieth</hi>) that ſhould trouble them worſe then he had done. So <hi>Luther</hi> did indeed.</p>
                  <p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Hieronymus Savonarala</hi> an Italian Monk, was a great adverſary to the popiſh Clergy, yet preaching nothing but the plain word of God, as touching,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The free juſtification in Chriſt through faith.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the communion ought to be adminiſtred in both kinds.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That popiſh pardons were of no effect.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Denied the Popes ſupremacy.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Preached againſt the filthineſſe of the Cardinals and Clergy.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Keies were not only given to <hi>Peter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="7">7. That the Pope did neither follow the life, nor doctrine of Chriſt; and that he attributed more to his own pardons, then to Chriſts merits, and therefore was Antichriſt.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the Popes excommunications are not to be feared; and he that doth fear them is excommunicated of God.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That auricular confeſſion is not neceſſary. All which he ſtood unto with two Friers, who were all three hanged openly, and then burned. And now began the Art of Printing, which did ruine the Pope more then preaching.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Martin Luther</hi> was by the ſpeciall providence of God called forth to fight the cauſe of truth againſt the Pope, even out of the Cloiſter of <hi>Auguſtinian</hi> Friers, in the reign of the Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth, who much endeavoured to ſuppreſſe him. 1. By convening the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of <hi>Germany</hi> at the Town of <hi>Worms.</hi> But before I come to his ſtory, you may ſee that there was in every age ſome that profeſſed the Proteſtant tenets of Religion before <hi>Luthers</hi> time. I could reckon abundance more, but I avoid prolixity, and reſerve the reader to the Catalogues and Martyrologies of Religious men.</p>
                  <p>I return therefore to <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> who being ſummoned, appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red at the Convention at <hi>Worms,</hi> but would revoke nothing of his writings, which were concerning, 1. The grounds of Chriſtian Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion. The ſecond contained a reproofe and detection of papacy, and popiſh doctrines and manners. The third ſort contained an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of thoſe particular perſons, who did abet and maintain the Roman tyranny, and deface his writings: none of which he would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant. He had ſafe conduct back again to his own Country, but the Emperour to pleaſe the Pope, who had not yet confirmed him in his Empire, ſent out a Writ of outlawry againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and all his adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents,
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:37858:96"/>commanding <hi>Luther</hi> to be apprehended, and his books burnt. Then followed another Convention at <hi>Norinbergh,</hi> of the eſtates of <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſuppreſſe <hi>Luther,</hi> to which the Pope excited them by his Legate <hi>Cheregatus.</hi> But the eſtates found it dangerous to proceed with rigor againſt him, but deſired to reſerſe it to the next free Councill called in <hi>Germany,</hi> and in the mean time they would take care to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent diſorders. But in the mean time an hundred grievances at leaſt were preſented by the <hi>Germans</hi> to that Convention, and by them to the Pope: the chiefe whereof were,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That many things were prohibited by humane conſtitution, that were not prohibited of God, and many things rejected, which were of God commanded.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That the Popes pardons were inſufferable, which perſwading the people of the power of them, was the cauſe of many abominati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons committed, becauſe for mony they might be pardoned.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That Eccleſiaſticall men are free from the ſecular power what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they commit.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That Prieſts are ſuffered to have Concubines for monie, and the chaſter men are compelled to pay monie for them, and ſo may have them if they will. But no anſwer came either from Pope <hi>Adrian,</hi> or <hi>Clement</hi> the ſeventh after him, though he ſent Cardinall <hi>Campeius</hi> to the next Convention at <hi>Norinberg.</hi> But <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperours brother, and Cardinall <hi>Campeius,</hi> the Duke of <hi>Bavaria,</hi> and ſome Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops,<note place="margin">Joan. Sleidan. <hi>Comment.</hi>
                     </note> aſſembled themſelves in a Conventicle at <hi>Ratisbone,</hi> and ratified certaine Articles againſt <hi>Luther</hi> and his books. Afterward were two other Conventions at <hi>Spiers:</hi> in the firſt many bils of complaints were put up againſt Monks and Friers, and the priviledges of the Clergy above the Civill power. Alſo againſt holy daies; and that the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of meats and ceremonies might be free; and that the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour would appoint a Provnciall Councill (ſince a generall could not be had) in <hi>Germany</hi> for matters of Religion, or elſe ſuſpend the decree of <hi>Worms</hi> againſt the followers of <hi>Luther</hi> and himſelfe: the laſt was granted. And at the next convention at <hi>Spiers,</hi> was by a few Princes decreed; That ſuch Cities as had altered Religion ſhould make no farther change; and that other places ſhould obey the decree of <hi>Wormes,</hi> till a generall Councill: That all men ſhould uſe the maſſe that would, even where it was aboliſhed: That Anabaptiſts ſhould be puniſhed to death; and miniſters ſhould teach by the Churches interpretations: That the doctrine of the Lords Supper ſhould not be received: That no Princes ſhould receive ſtrangers, that for Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion came to their dominions.</p>
                  <p>This was reſiſted by the Duke of <hi>Saxony,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denberg,</hi> and the Princes of <hi>Luneberg,</hi> and the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe,</hi> and ſome others, and made proteſtation againſt it, and that name is given to all that decline the Romiſh Religion.<note place="margin">The name Proteſtants.</note> To theſe did cleave fourteen Cities, who appealed to the Emperour, and a generall Councill, or a Provinciall. They ſent Embaſſadors to the Emperour, who handled them very roughly with threatnings.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Proteſtants bound themſelves in a Covenant at <hi>Smal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caldy,</hi>
                     <pb n="155" facs="tcp:37858:96"/>to aſſiſt each other if any of them were purſued for Religion. This diſcontented the Councill of the Empire. The Emperour publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed a decree, that though the confeſſion preſented to him at the Town <hi>Auguſta</hi> was conſuted (to which the Proteſtants were not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to reply,<note place="margin">The <hi>Auguſtane</hi> Confeſſion.</note> but willed to return to the Romiſh Church) yet he would give them a ſpace to return. In which time they ſhould keep peace, and alter Religion no farther, but ſuffer every man to follow the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that pleaſed. The Proteſtants anſwered, they could not obey that decree with a ſafe conſcience. Therefore the Emperour ſet forth another Decree, wherein he confirmed the Romiſh Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in all points; and that his Court called the Chamber, ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed againſt the Proteſtants in judgement; and that no Proteſtant Prince ſhould bear office in his Court, and that all Papiſts ſhould be taken into his protection againſt their own Princes: therefore the Proteſtants and their Embaſſadors met again at <hi>Smalcaldy,</hi> and confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med their league begun.</p>

Therefore the Senate proclaimed throughout all their territories, that the traditions of men ſhould be aboliſhed, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1523"/> and the Goſpell of Chriſt purely taught out of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1625"/> to maintain popiſh tenets of tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, and the Maſſe, invocation of Saints, and for the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of Images and Purgatory, which <hi>Ecchius</hi> offred to maintain and prove. He was oppoſed by <hi>Oecolampadius,</hi> Preacher of <hi>Baſil,</hi> and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was not permitted by the Senate of <hi>Zurick,</hi> to be there, becauſe the <hi>Helvetians</hi> were his fierce and deadly enemies. It was concluded that all ſhould remain in that Religion they had hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto kept, and ſhould admit of no new doctrine in their dominions, but ſhould ſollow the authority of the Councill.</p>
                  <p>The Senate and people of <hi>Berne</hi> not content herewith (one of the chiefe Cities of <hi>Helvetia</hi>) aſſigned a diſputation there to be held, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1527"/> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led all the Biſhops about them thereunto, granted ſafe conduct to all that would come thither. The diſputation was to be decided by Scriptures: the Propoſitions to be diſputed upon were theſe.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the true Church which is the myſticall body of Chriſt ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth out of Gods Word, and continueth in the ſame, and heareth not the voice of ſtrangers.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It makes no Lawes without Gods word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That the traditions of the Church cannot bind conſcience, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept they be conſonant to Gods Word.</p>
                  <pb n="156" facs="tcp:37858:97"/>
                  <p n="4">4. That Chriſt hath made full ſatisfaction for ſin, and he that ſaith there is any other way to ſalvation, or to aboliſh ſin, denieth Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. That Chriſt is not received corporally in the Sacrament of the Lords Supper.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. That the Maſſe offered up for the quick and dead, is contrary to the Word of God, and diſgracing the ſacrifice of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. That Chriſt is only to be invocated as Mediator between God and man.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. That the Scripture ſheweth no ſuch place as Purgatory for the purging of ſoules after death; and therefore all popiſh Ceremonies, as Dirges, Lamps and Tapers, profit not the dead at all.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. That pictures and images of Saints are not to be ſet up in Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, or to be worſhipped.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. That Matrimony is not denied to any order of men, but by the word of God permitted to all men; and becauſe fornication is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, therefore ſingle life is not to be forced upon people. All which propoſitions were defended by <hi>Oecolampadius, Bucer,</hi> and others, againſt all oppoſers, and therefore ratified by the Senate; and it was decreed, that Maſſes, Altars and Images ſhould be aboliſhed. In me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moriall of this Reformation, they cauſed a pillar to be ſet up engra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with golden letters, with the time when it was done, namely, 1528. many other Cities, as <hi>Strouſbrough, Baſil</hi> and <hi>Geneva,</hi> followed their example.</p>
                  <p>But many other Towns popiſhly affected, did ſide with <hi>Ferdinand</hi> the Emperours brother, and Deputy in <hi>Germany,</hi> to ſuppreſſe this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation in <hi>Berne</hi> and <hi>Zurik.</hi> Theſe Towns were the <hi>Lucernates, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rani, Suitenſes, <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nternaldii,</hi> and <hi>Tugiani,</hi> who much abuſing the Reformed <hi>Tigurines</hi> and <hi>Bernatas,</hi> made them ſo angry, that they ſtopped the waies to thoſe five Towns, that no victuals could come to them. Upon this the five unreformed made war upon them, and had the better, in which skirmiſhing <hi>Zuinglius</hi> was ſlain, and his body abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, cut in pieces and burned, yet the Reformed continued in their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and peace was concluded by the mediation of the King of <hi>France,</hi> and ſome Cantons of <hi>Switzerland.</hi>

                  <p>For the firſt, you may find that the Pope came in by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nivance of peaceable and quiet Princes, who not diſcerning the Popes policy, after <hi>Phocas</hi> the Emperour had made him univerſall Bishop, how he did work upon Princes of weak judgement; as alſo upon ſuch as he found to be ſuperſtitious; or that were litigious, and ſtood in need of his help; and ſo did wind himſelfe by intruſion, and uſed his
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:37858:98"/>poſſeſſion with tyranny. But this intruſion could never be warranted by any juſt claime, through poſſeſſion or ſubmiſſion to him in tract of time, by cuſtome or preſcription, the foundation of his firſt authority being ſurreptitious; for we cannot find any Brittiſh or Saxon Kings, that have obliged themſelves or this Kingdome, ſubmiſſively to the Pope. But you may find that when <hi>Auſtin</hi> the Monk was ſent into <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by Pope <hi>Greg.</hi> 1. to bring the Clergy to the ceremonies and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Roman Church (not to make Chriſtians in <hi>England,</hi> which was done many hundred years before, in the time of King <hi>Lucius,</hi> who deſired Baptiſm of Pope <hi>Elutherius,</hi> for himſelf and his people) that he, nor any Prieſt that came with him into the Iſle of <hi>Thanet,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bed. <hi>l.</hi> 1. <hi>c.</hi> 26.</note> did preach till they had licenſe from the King. But it is of courteſie (not duty) the Pope hath had much regard in <hi>England,</hi> as appeareth in that his Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gats and Nuncioes have had here entertainment. But this was no more then they had in other places of the world, where their uſurped authority was rejected: So in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Africa.</hi> This proveth no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of any right he had in <hi>England:</hi> for though this Realm hath ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſometimes appeals to <hi>Rome,</hi> yet you ſhall find that they have been oftner prohibited, and the Popes Buls condemned, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications ſlighted, and his decrees rejected; and that the King made Lawes and Eccleſiaſticall Canons by Parliaments and Synods, without the Popes leave. As you may ſee in the daies of King <hi>Eg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> and <hi>Alfred,</hi> about the appeale of <hi>Wilfride,</hi> Archbishop of <hi>York,</hi> who was the firſt that ever appealed (before the <hi>Norman</hi> conqueſt) to the Pope, and in whoſe behalfe the Pope ſent Nuncioes to <hi>England,</hi> with a Letter or Bull, to reſtore <hi>Wilfride</hi> to his pluralities, of which the King, and great Councill of the Kingdome, the Archbishop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Clergy, had diveſted him. But they would not yield to the Popes deſire to reſtore <hi>Wilfride,</hi> til he had ſubmitted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe, and reſigned thoſe Monaſteries he held, which had moved the contention. So after the <hi>Norman</hi> conqueſt, in the reign of <hi>Henry</hi> the firſt, Pope <hi>Paſchalis</hi> put a new oath upon Archbishops, to be taken when they received their Pall; which <hi>Anſelme</hi> the Archbishop ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving taken, thought himſelfe obliged to maintain the appellations to <hi>Rome;</hi> but King <hi>Henry</hi> pleaded the fundamentall lawes, which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bad any ſuch appeals without the Kings licence; and that they were a violation to the Crown; and a Law was made, that if any should bring the Popes letter or mandate in the Realm,<note place="margin">Rog.

It is true, that Pope <hi>Nicolas</hi> grants to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, and his ſucceſſors, that which he ſtood in no need of, namely, the protection of all the Churches in <hi>England,</hi> and to make Lawes with the advice of their Bishops and Abbots in his ſtead for governing the ſame.

                  <p>Now for the ſecond Queſtion how Chriſtian Religion came to be corrupted,<note place="margin">Rom. 1.8. Gild. <hi>de exid. &amp; Conq. Brit.</hi>
                     </note> being at firſt clear as <hi>Romes</hi> was in its Primitive profeſſion of it. 1. It is true that <hi>England</hi> had a light of the Goſpell, as it is thought, by <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea,</hi> and his colony of Chriſtians that came with him to <hi>Glaſſenbury,</hi> which was in the time of <hi>Tiberius</hi> the Emperours reign. <hi>Peter</hi> came not to <hi>Rome</hi> till the ſecond year of <hi>Claudius,</hi> to lay any foundation of a Church there. Nor do we find any plain face of a Church in <hi>England,</hi> till King <hi>Lucius</hi> and his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects were baptized; as you have read by <hi>Fugatius</hi> and <hi>Damianus,</hi> two Miniſters that <hi>Elutherius</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> fent to do it at King <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cius</hi> his requeſt. The Church of <hi>Rome</hi> continued faithfull 350. yeers after Chriſt, as I have ſhewed, and kept her ſelfe untainted with here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and was a covert and protection unto the profeſſors of truth. But after the Emperour <hi>Constantine</hi> and his ſucceſſors turned Chriſtians, Clergy men grew into great favour at Court, and ſo wealth and eaſe firſt begate ſecurity; then covetouſneſſe, then pride; next ambition; then deviſing of falſe tenets to maintain it, and ſuperſtitions to uphold it: then alſo hereſies to mask or depoſe truth. At laſt getting the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of univerſall Biſhop, the Eaſtern Church falling to decay, the world looked on the Pope, though not as upon one that ſhould be their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour in ſecular matters, yet as one that ſhould direct them in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines. He by ſubtilty of the Schoolmen, and policy and power, ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed tares; and though he ſeemed to keep the foundation, yet built be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide it; kept up the truth in unrighteouſneſſe, and delivered to the people by retaile what he pleaſed; ſhut up the Scriptures, and gave them humane traditions. Now Princes and Prieſts being ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:37858:99" rendition="simple:additions"/>of his piety, and cozened by his hypocriſie; others reveren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of his antiquity, and dazeled with his dignity; and others being remiſſe and idle, were contented to enjoy the world in quiet, and take any Religion that was offered them. Thus the world was made dark by <hi>Babylons</hi> cup, and had no feeling of the loſſe of truth, no more then the Pope had, except he were touched in his honours and profits. But God had pity upon his Church, and raiſed up now and then ſome to ſet up his truth, as you have ſee. And laſtly, <hi>Luther</hi> to oppoſe the Popes errors, and King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth to imitate his ſucceſſors, by aboliſhing his authority in <hi>England.</hi>

                  <p>Now then to your third Queſtion, How Reformation went on af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter King <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth. I have ſhewed you though that King did write againſt <hi>Luther,</hi> and aboliſhed the Popes power, yet he perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Proteſtants, and thoſe that profeſſed <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrin: of which there were many by reaſon of his books diſperſed in <hi>England. Luther</hi> himſelfe was much troubled. The Pope ſends forth his roaring Bull againſt him; he anſwereth it, and appeals to the next generall Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill. But his doctrine was very acceptable to good Chriſtians, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, though in ſome points they differed from him.

                  <p>Beyond the ſeas fell out great troubles. A Councill was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at <hi>Ratisbone</hi> to end controverſies of Religion, but no agreement, and ſo the Emperour referred the controverſie to the next generall, or provinciall Councill of <hi>Germany;</hi> but ſtill the popiſh ſide deſired to ſuppreſſe <hi>Luthers</hi> doctrine, but yet decrees againſt Proteſtants were ſuſpended; yet the fire of malice broke out againſt them; for <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> Duke of <hi>Brunſick</hi> invaded their Cities: the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> reſiſts him in the name of all the Proteſtants confederate at <hi>Smalcaldy,</hi> and won all his dominions. The Emperour and the King of <hi>France</hi> make peace, and both covenant to join, to reſtore the Romiſh Religion, which coſt <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Germany</hi> great troubles: for the King of <hi>France</hi> ſent <hi>Minerius</hi> Governor of <hi>Provence,</hi> againſt the <hi>Waldenſes</hi> (of whom you have heard) who dwelt in ſome part of that Countrie; as in <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rindol</hi> and <hi>Cabriere.</hi> They of <hi>Merindol,</hi> for fear fled into the woods. He ſpoiled and burned their Towns left deſolate: <hi>Cabriere</hi> was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered upon compoſition, but yet none were ſpared, but ſome killed in Churches; ſome burned in barns; ſome ſmothered in caves; o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent to the Gallies; others ſtarved in the woods. But God ſtrook <hi>Minerius</hi> with a ſad diſeaſe, a fire ſcorched him within; his limbs rotted, made bloody urine, and died in torments. The Emperour <hi>Charls</hi> the fifth by policy ſuppreſſeth theſe Princes that upheld the Proteſtants: as the Duke of <hi>Saxony</hi> and others; as the <hi>Landgrave</hi> of <hi>Heſſe.</hi> About the year, 1546. when the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> was gathered to convene, where the Emperour and the Pope made a league againſt the proteſtants, and the Pope gave 200000 Crowns to make war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, to the <hi>Venetians,</hi> and maintained an army for a while, to cut them off. The Emperour laboured hard with many of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, to ſubmit to the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> as alſo the free Cities; and in
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:37858:99"/>hope they would, he deſired that the Councill of <hi>Trent</hi> which was carried from <hi>Trent</hi> to <hi>Bononia,</hi> might come to <hi>Trent</hi> again, which they refuſed: upon which the Emperour diſanulled all they did at <hi>Bono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> and ſaid he would take care of Religion himſelfe. And to this end conſulted with Princes and Biſhops about it, who drew out a book of Reformation, called <hi>Interim;</hi> to which few would conſent, and many fled away to other Countries, becauſe they would not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it: As <hi>Muſculus</hi> preacher of <hi>Auſburgh,</hi> fled to <hi>Switzerland: Bren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> from <hi>Suere</hi> to the Duke of <hi>Wirtembergh: Martin Bucer,</hi> and <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus Fagius</hi> from <hi>Germany</hi> to <hi>England.</hi> The Pope himſelfe would not allow it without correction, becauſe it allowed the marriage of Prieſts, and the uſe of the Sacraments in both kinds, though it main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the reſt of the Roman Religion. But eſpecially the City of <hi>Magdeburgh</hi> withſtood the book, nor acknowledged the Councill of <hi>Trent.</hi>

For the Prince having diſſolved his army, re-delivered the places conquered. The Proteſtants at their return to their Towns, were forced to lay down their arms, and to keep within their houſes: upon which many were maſſacred, about three thouſand, and all devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces put in practice to intercept the chiefe leaders of the Proteſtant part, who by great providence eſcaped to <hi>Rochel.</hi> And from thence the Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> complained much in his letters to the King, of the breach of the pacification made, ſealed, and ſworn to by the King himſelfe; but he received no anſwer. But the Kings brother, Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> is made Generall of an army againſt the Proteſtants. The Queen of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> and <hi>Andelot</hi> join forces in defence of them, and ſo began the third civill war; in which the old Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> was taken and ſlaine, and <hi>Andelot</hi> died, as is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of poiſon, which was found in his body when it was opened.

The ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirall and principall Noble men of the Proteſtants were invited. But the Queen of <hi>Navar</hi> died ſuddenly, and was thought to be poiſoned with a pair of gloves. The King ſeemed very ſorrowfull; but the marriage went on, and was celebrated on <hi>Auguſt</hi> the 18. 1572. But on the 22. day after the ſame month, the Admirall was ſhot in the arme going from the <hi>Louver:</hi> upon which the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> deſired to depart from <hi>Paris;</hi> but the King of <hi>France</hi> prevailed with them to ſtay, and he himſelfe went to viſit the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and ſeemed to lament very much, and ſet a guard about him, as if to protect him, and cauſed the proteſtants to take all their lodgings neer him to be his aſſiſtants, if any commotion ſhould ariſe. But the next night after, the Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> had ſouldiers ready planted in the ſtreet to make a maſſacre of the prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. And upon the ſign given, the Kings guard killed the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, and flung his body out at windowe: at which the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> greatly rejoiced, and encouraged the ſouldiers to kill the reſt of the proteſtants, who made havock, and killed man, woman and child which they could find, crying, that wicked ſeed of the proteſtants ſhould be quite rooted out. So all thoſe that attended in the <hi>Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> about the King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince of <hi>Condie,</hi> were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to diſarm and go forth; where they were all ſlain. The King of <hi>Navar,</hi> and the Prince, were both brought before the King, and threatned to be ſlain, except they would renounce their Religion. The King of <hi>Navar</hi> deſired the King to remember the friendſhip made up between them. The Prince of <hi>Condie</hi> more ſtoutly ſaid, he would not renounce his Religion for fear of his life. Some proteſtants that were lodged in the <hi>Fobers</hi> of St <hi>Germane,</hi> eſcaped by flight.

                  <p>No; for though their chiefe Leaders were murthered; yet there were certain Towns which were full of proteſtants, as <hi>Rochel, Mountalban, Nimes,</hi> and <hi>Sarſarre.

                  <p>No; for ſtill their enemies ſollicited the King to break peace with the Proteſtants, and finding him unwilling, they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at <hi>Perone, Nemours,</hi> and <hi>Nancy,</hi> about 1576. and made a league to root out the Proteſtants, becauſe the Proteſtants did not yield up their cautionary Towns, after ſix yeers expired; whereas they had obtained of the King a longer time. But the death of <hi>Alanzon</hi> the Kings brother, dying in the Low Countries, and the King having no iſſue, and therefore they feared the King of <hi>Navars</hi> ſucceſſion, made them extream mad upon this League.</p>
                  <p>Now the King alſo perceived that the Leaguers aimed at his life and crown, and to ſet up whom they pleaſed to ſucceed him: and this he did upon good grounds. 1. Becauſe libels were ſcattered about <hi>Paris</hi> to his diſhonor. 2. Becauſe the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> raiſed an army,
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:37858:102"/>and was made generall of it. 3. Becauſe they carried the war ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther towards <hi>Paris</hi> then the Proteſtant Towns. Theſe things put him in ſo great fear; that he deſired the Queen Mother to procure the Duke to lay down arms, and he would give him any part of his Realm to let him live in peace. This made the Leaguers to ask high requeſts and ſecurities; ſo that the Proteſtants were prohibited to exerciſe their religion, and to turn Papiſts, or elſe to depart the Realm. Upon this the King of <hi>Navar</hi> began to oppoſe himſelfe with the Prince of <hi>Condy,</hi> and the Duke <hi>Mommerancy.</hi> And yet although the King of <hi>France</hi> and the Leaguers were united, yet the Pope excommunicates him, and declares him uncapable of the Kingdome. There came alſo Embaſſadors from the Electors of <hi>Germany,</hi> to deſire his favour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the Proteſtants; who received no contenting anſwer, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned. Then the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> fearing invaſion of <hi>France</hi> by the <hi>Rut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> adviſed the King to ſet quickly upon the Proteſtants army, under the command of the King of <hi>Navar;</hi> but were diſcomfited at <hi>Contras.</hi> However the Pope much extolled the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers of <hi>France</hi> advanced him above the King: with which he was ſo puffed up, that he came to the King at <hi>Soiſſons,</hi> and after to <hi>Paris,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to make him grant many unreaſonable requeſts againſt his own honor, and for the utter ruine of the Proteſtants, which raiſed ſuch troubles in <hi>Paris,</hi> that the King fled to <hi>Chartneſſe,</hi> and to <hi>Roan,</hi> meditating revenge; yet he reſolves to join with the Leaguers, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then the Proteſtants; and therefore the Proteſtants could not be heard at <hi>Bloyes</hi> by the Parliament, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1589"/> though the Duke of <hi>Guiſe</hi> was there ſlaine, when they petitioned for reſtoration to their Religion, Goods and Liberty. But the Leaguers ceaſed not till they had procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a declaration from the King and the Aſſembly, to diſable the King of <hi>Navar</hi> from ſucceſſion to the Crown of <hi>France.</hi> The other Leaguers at <hi>Paris</hi> were mad for the death of the Duke of <hi>Guiſe,</hi> and railed at the King; raiſed mony for wars againſt him; and the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Sorbon</hi> declared the people of <hi>France</hi> free from their obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the King, and ſo might take arms againſt him. Upon this the Parliament at <hi>Bloyes</hi> diſſolves, and the King prepares to ſuppreſſe the rebellion at <hi>Paris.</hi> To this purpoſe he took truce with the King of <hi>Navar;</hi> by whoſe forces he diſcomfited the Leaguers, and intended to beſiege <hi>Paris,</hi> but the Leaguers prevented him, by procuring Frier <hi>Jaques</hi> to kill the King, who did it in his chamber with a knife, while he read a letter the Frier brought him. This was done in that cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, ſay ſome, wherein the maſſacre at <hi>Paris</hi> was formerly plotted, this King being then Duke of <hi>Anjou,</hi> and chiefe in the plot.</p>

                        <hi>July</hi> 25. 1593.</note> But he then began to halt in Religion; for the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and divers Biſhops, prevailed with him to hear maſſe in St <hi>Dennis</hi> Church. But ſtill the Leaguers hated him, and ſent one <hi>Peter Burrier</hi> to ſlay him, by the inſtigation of a Capuchin Frier, a
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:37858:102"/>Prieſt, and a Jeſuite; but he was prevented. Upon this the King pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed his declaration, preſcribing a months liberty to all that would come in and ſubmit to his government; but elſe they ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards find no favour from him. By this means many Towns yielded to him, and at laſt <hi>Paris</hi> it ſelfe, which he entred ſo peaceably, that within two hours the ſhops were all ſet open, as if no wars had been.

This King eſcaped many treaſons plotted againſt his life. And yet 1604. reſtored the Jeſuits again, and afterward ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted them to go into <hi>Navar</hi> and <hi>Berne,</hi> to the great diſcontent of the Judges and Officers of that Country; yet 1606. this King made ſpeciall good orders in the behalfe of the reformed Religion, confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming the Edict of <hi>Nantes,</hi> 1598. concerning their pacification. But this halting between two opinions, did not certainly pleaſe God; for though he ſuffered the Proteſtants to have a nationall Synod at <hi>Gap,</hi> concerning their doctrin and diſcipline, and therein to declare the Pope to be Antichriſt foretold by the word of God, and made it one of the Articles of their confeſſion; yet taking no warning by that ſtroke given on his mouth formerly, he was ſtrook to the heart by a curſed villain, one <hi>Frances Ravillac,</hi> riding in his Caroch, even the next day after his Queens coronation day, moved thereunto as he confeſſed, by no other reaſon, but becauſe the King maintained two religions in <hi>France,</hi> and by reading the book of <hi>Mariana</hi> the Spaniſh Jeſuite, and <hi>Bellarmins</hi> book of the Popes temporall power: which books by a decree of the Colledge of <hi>Sorbon,</hi> and by ſentence of the Parliament, were burnt; as alſo <hi>Jasper Scoppius</hi> his book, containing the ſame doctrine, tending to the ſubjects rebellion againſt Princes, 1612. This ſoule fact was ſuſpected to be of the Jeſuits plotting, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Father <hi>Cotton</hi> endevoured to wipe off the aſperſion; yet the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of the book called <hi>Anticotton,</hi> refuſed it, and proved the Jeſuits to be the maintainers of that doctrine, and were guilty of this Kings death, by <hi>Ravilac's</hi> own confeſſion to father <hi>Aubigny;</hi> who being examined upon it, ſaid, that God had given him the grace alwaies to forget what he heard in confeſſion; and ſo he ſaved his neck by that fine and falſe excuſe. But he that cals light out of darkneſſe, brought out of this damnable act more reſpect to the Proteſtant, and a check to the Pope: For now the great chamber called the <hi>Tornelle,</hi> made a decree againſt the Popes temporall power. And the Proteſtants be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan an aſſembly of the reformed Churches at <hi>Saumur,</hi> where Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier <hi>de Bulloin</hi> told them from the King and Queen Regent, that all their juſt requeſts ſhould be favourably anſwered, and whatſoever had been promiſed ſhould be paied.

So they turned the Citizens out of the Town, plun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the Churches and houſes, and made orders, that the inhabitants ſhould bring in all their mony into the common ſtock, upon pain of death, and they burned all books ſave the Bible.

                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:37858:104"/>wrote in tables, that it was the will of God that twelve men of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhould govern the City; and that a man might marry as many wives as he pleaſed; and he beheaded ſome that oppoſed it. He him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe took fifteen, and many of theſe brethren upon this ordinance, lay with the hanſomeſt women without marriage or contract. He was called King of New <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and proclaimed King of <hi>Zion.</hi> But his Apoſtles were executed as ſeditious perſons; and he and his Prophet were hanged in iron chains, upon the high ſteeple of St <hi>Lambert,</hi> after <hi>Munſter</hi> was taken, 1535. being beſieged halfe a year. The madneſſe of this man was ſtrange: for one of his wives pitying the diſtreſſe of the City, he cut off her head himſelf in the market place.<note place="margin">Sleid. 154.</note> And another time at his great feaſt, to which another falſe Prophet had called <hi>Thuſcocuvar,</hi> had excited him as being ſent from God, he accuſed a man of treaſon, and cut off his head, and returning, adminiſtred the communion with thoſe bloody hands.

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:37858:105"/>come of a woman, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. and of <hi>Davids</hi> line, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 132.11. and that woman ſhould be a virgin, <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the 7. and that her name was <hi>Mary,</hi> ſaith <hi>Luke, cap.</hi> 1. and yet ſhe could not be his mother if he had not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken fleſh of her, nor our fleſh have any hope of eternall life.

                     </note> for they beleeve he was ſo born, but theſe curſe the flesh of the Virgin, and ſo deny Chriſt to be come in the flesh, 2 <hi>Ioh. v.</hi> 7.2. they ſay in <hi>Moravia,</hi> that Chriſt was not true God, but only better gifted then other men; yet St <hi>Iohn</hi> ſaith, The Word was God, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. and Chriſt ſaid, he and his Father were one, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10. and he that ſees him, ſeeth the Father, <hi>Iohn</hi> 24.9, 10. <hi>Michael Servetus,</hi> a Spaniard, held the ſame, who was burnt in <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va.</hi> And <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> who called the Creed of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Creed of Satanaſius; he was juſtly executed at <hi>Berne.</hi> Thirdly, they hold we are not ſaved by faith, but by the works of charity and affliction; yet Chriſt ſaith, we obtain eternall life by beleeving on him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.16. So <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 3.24, 28. for afflictions, they are either puniſhments of ſin, or Gods corrections, but no cauſes of juſtification or ſalvation. But the blood of Chriſt only clenſeth us from all ſin, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1. and by him only we have peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. And fourthly, they deny originall ſin, becauſe Chriſt hath taken away the ſins of the world; but that is the penalty, not the being of it. So they ſay that children doing neither good nor evill, are under grace, and without ſin. But then how comes death to lay hold on them? <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.14. and <hi>cap.</hi> 6.23. And therefore fifthly, they may well deny baptiſme to them, if they have no originall ſin. But Chriſt ſaid, let little children come to me, and yet none can tell how they ſhould come, but by this Ordinance. Sixthly, they rebaptize people, which is no where commanded in Scripture, nor allowed by the Church, nor the imperiall lawes, which put them to death that did, or ſuffered it to be done. Seventhly, they expect a Kingdome, by ſome called the fiſt Monarchy, wherein they hope to reign alone, and deſtroy the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly. This ſavours of carnall and worldly wiſdome; for Chriſts Kingdome is not of this world, <hi>Iohn</hi> 18. (but is ſpirituall) ſo is the meat and drink of it, <hi>Rom.</hi> ſo are the weapons of it, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. Nor can they reign alone and kill all the ungodly, unleſſe they kill themſelves too. But both muſt grow together till the harveſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. Theſe people do but furbuſh the old error of the Chiliaſts or Millenaries, who ſaid the Saints muſt raign 1000 yeers on the earth, before the laſt judgement, who were by the Church condemned above 1000 yeers ſince. Eighthly, they ſay with the old Pelagians, that man by his own free will, can do all that God hath commanded, or elſe God gave his law in vain, nor would he puniſh delinquents, if he had not given them power to do it, which is contrary to Scripture; for the Law is holy,<note place="margin">Rom. 7.</note> juſt, and good, but we are ſold under ſin, and ſo our fleſh is at enmity with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and therefore it muſt be given him from above, <hi>Iohn</hi> 3. for the naturall man is dead in ſin, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2. and ſurely if <hi>Adam</hi> could not of himſelfe ſtand in obedience by his free will, in the ſtate of innocence, how can we in the ſtate of nocency ſince his fall. Nor did God give the Law in reſpect that we could obey it, but to
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:37858:105"/>ſhew his perfection in making it, and to make us find our imperfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that we might flie to his grace in Chriſt, who for us hath fulfilled it. Ninthly, they ſeparate themſelves from all Churches, becauſe they account themſelves only pure, and therefore will not ſay the Lords Praier, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſses,</hi> ſuppoſing that they have no ſin. But at ſuch God is offended as with ſmoke, becauſe they make him a ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.8, 9. So they account the office of the Miniſtry of no uſe, but depend upon peculiar revelation; yet God hath bid people to ſeek the Law at the mouth of the Prieſt, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44. but any one of them will preach, of what trade ſoever he be, though neither called of God as <hi>Heb.</hi> nor by any authority conſtituted among the profeſſed people of Chriſt; and ſo they do preach without being ſent, contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to St <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 10. and ſo bring the Church into confuſion.</p>
                  <p>And as their tenets are not fit to be ſuffered in the Church, ſo nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are they in the Commonwealth.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Sleidan</hi> in com. lib. <hi>10.</hi>
                     </note> For they hold that it is not lawfull for a Chriſtian to be a Magiſtrate, nor for man to ſubject him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to them, but may depoſe them; nor to take an oath of fidelity to them; nor may a Magiſtrate puniſh a malefactor with death. Firſt, he muſt not be a Magiſtrate they ſay, becauſe Chriſt is the only King of the Church; yet that proves not but that other Kings may be in the Church to ſerve under Chriſt. So though it be ſaid, that when <hi>Shiloh (viz.)</hi> Chriſt is come, the ſcepter ſhall depart from <hi>Judah;</hi> but that is from the Jewes, not from all Commonwealths. It is true, he denied to the ſons of <hi>Zebedee</hi> ſuperiority; but that was becauſe he would correct their error, ſuppoſing his Kingdome to be earthly, and becauſe he called them not to Civill, but Eccleſiaſticall offices. And what though Chriſt refuſed to be a King, and to judge between bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren; it was becauſe it belonged not to his office, not that thereby he meant to abrogate the juriſdiction of other men, which was given to them from above, as he told <hi>Pilate.</hi> So though we are forbidden to judge other men, yet thereby is ſignified private and raſh, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely, and wicked cenſures. And ſo though Chriſt prophecieth that ſome Magiſtrates ſhall be perſecutors of the Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24. yet the ſpirit tels us that ſome ſhall be nurſing fathers, <hi>Iſa.</hi> So Chriſt bid <hi>Peter</hi> to put up his ſword, yet that was the materiall, not the civill ſword, or the ſword of private revenge; nor was <hi>Peter</hi> a publick Magiſtrate. So though <hi>Jotham</hi> in his parable ſheweth,<note place="margin">Judg. 9.</note> that Kingſhip was affected by the Brier only, but not by the Olive, Vine, or the Fig tree, yet that proveth not that only the wicked, and not the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, may take upon them place of judicature: for Parables and Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gories prove nothing in doctrines. Beſide, that Parable was ſpoken particularly againſt <hi>Abimelech;</hi> and from particulars, we cannot prove generall poſitions.</p>
                  <p>Now, if it be lawfull for one to be a Magiſtrate, it is as lawfull for another to be ſubject, becauſe every power is of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.1, 2. and the fifth Commandement bids us honor our Superiours, and nature teacheth ſubjection of the members to the head. Nor this is not ſervile but civill, and ſuch as was before <hi>Adam</hi> fell, as <hi>Eve</hi> being ſubordinate to <hi>Adam.</hi> It is a weak objection to ſay, that there ought to be no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:37858:106"/>under the Goſpell, becauſe beleevers are thereby admitted to the Kingdome of heaven, and ſo to be in ſubjection only to Chriſt: for as in ſpirituals we are to be only his ſubjects, ſo in temporals we are to be ſubject to men for order ſake, and alſo for their tuition and defence of us in our ſtates and ſtations. And for this cauſe faith St <hi>Paul,</hi> you pay tribute, becauſe he is the miniſter of God for thy good, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.4, 6. And whatſoever Anabaptiſts ſay, they themſelves found ſuch a neceſſity of order in government, that they willingly did ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit to <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Leydens</hi> government in <hi>Munſter.</hi> And that this ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction may be the firmer, it is lawfull to take an oath of fidelity to the Magiſtrate, though the Anabaptiſts are againſt it, by which means they open a door to all rebellion, treaſon, and truce-breakings. That oaths are lawfull it is plain, becauſe it ſeems to be a part of Gods worſhip, being a calling upon to witneſſe truth, and an acknowled<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging God to be the greateſt; yea, becauſe it is commanded of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> thou ſhalt ſwear by my name. And much more is the oath of fidelity lawful; therefore <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſervant ſware to him; and <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſware to <hi>Abimelech; Zedekiah</hi> to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar,</hi> which is called the oath of God, and the breach of it God ſware that he would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 17.19. Now from hence it will follow, that a Chriſtian Magiſtrate may puniſh the evill doers, how elſe can he defend them that are good; nor can the Magiſtrate executing malefactors, be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to kill, but in juſtice to give a juſt reward for his demerits. Nor can their tenets be conſiſtent with oeconomy, or government of families. And that firſt, becauſe they hold that a Chriſtian man ought to have nothing proper, but all things muſt be common, becauſe the firſt converts did ſo act. Yet St <hi>Peter</hi> ſaid to <hi>Ananias,</hi> that before he gave his goods in common it was his own, and ſo he was not bound to it by the example of others, much leſſe by any precept, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.4. therefore St <hi>Paul</hi> makes alms a free gift, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. and admoniſheth rich men not to forſake their goods, though to be liberall in good works, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6. So they ſay they may put away their wives if they be not of their religion,<note place="margin">

                     </note> contrary to St <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. (and indeed nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Joſeph</hi> nor <hi>Moſaes</hi> put away their wives, though neither of them were <hi>Iſraelites</hi>) and therefore they perſwade women alſo to leave their husbands to follow them; for they hold it lawfull to have ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wives, contrary to the Prophet, <hi>Malach.</hi> 2.15. Did not he make one that he might ſeek a godly ſeed? And St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, let every man have his own wife, and the woman her own husband.</p>
                  <p>This Sect broke into divers denominations. Firſt into four, which four <hi>David George</hi> thought to unite,<note place="margin">

The firſt ſort called the <hi>Muncerians,</hi> of <hi>Muncerus,</hi> of whom I have ſpoken before.<note place="margin">An old Sect 130 years ago.</note> Secondly, Apoſtolikes, becauſe they wandered about with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſtaves, ſhooes, or mony. They waſhed each others feet, and left houſes, wives, and trades. They grew chargeable to the common purſe; they put away their wives when they pleaſed, at laſt were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicated by the reſt of the brethren as idle vagabonds. The third were Separatiſts, becauſe they ſequeſtred themſelves from the

The fourth were called Cathariſts, becauſe they pretended purity without ſin, and ſaid, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren had no originall ſin, and denied them baptiſme, and would not ſay the Lords Praier. The fifth were <hi>Silentes,</hi> becauſe they ſeldome ſpake. The ſixth were called Enthuſiaſts, who ſaid the gift of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy by dreams came to them, and therefore would lie much in tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, like <hi>Mahomet,</hi> when he was in a paroxiſme, or fit of the falling ſickneſſe, or like our Quakers. They ſaid Anabaptiſme was holy, but childrens baptiſme came from the devill. The ſeventh were cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Liberians, or Libertines, who miſunderſtanding the liberty of Chriſt to be worldly and carnall, thought themſelves free from pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rents, tributes or tithes, though Chriſt paied tribute to <hi>Caeſar;</hi> and alſo took liberty to commit all uncleanneſſe. The eighth were called Adamites, becauſe they thought themſelves in the ſtate of innocence, and therefore accounted cloaths to be a ſign of the curſe, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore went naked, as did the old Adamiani, 300 yeers after Chriſt in their Conventicles, or Hupocauſta, under ground, caves which were warmed by ſecret furnaces or ſtoves, in which place they ſtood naked, men and women. The ninth ſort were called Hutites, from their au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <hi>Iohn Huta.</hi> Theſe denied Chriſts divinity with the Arrians. The tenth were called <hi>Auguſtinians,</hi> who conceived there was no entrance into Paradiſe, till <hi>Auguſtin</hi> the Bohemian opened it; forgetting that Chriſt ſaid to the thiefe on the croſſe, this day thou ſhalt be with me in Paradiſe. The eleventh was the Beuckeldians, who ſaid that it was an holy thing to have many wives at once, forgetting <hi>Mal.</hi> 2.14. where it is called trechery againſt the wife of thy youth, of which covenant God is the witneſſe. The twelfth was the Melchioriſts, who of one <hi>Melchior Hoffman</hi> their Prophet at <hi>Strauſborough,</hi> whom they look for to come with <hi>Elias</hi> at the day of judgement; and hold that Chriſt was not conceived and born of the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary,</hi> but only paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed through her as water through a conduit; in which they agree with the old Eutychians. The thirteenth were the <hi>Georgians,</hi> ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led of <hi>David George,</hi> the originall of the Familiſts, who thought him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a greater Prophet then Chriſt, and that he would riſe three yeers after his death, and reſtore the Kingdome of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but he was never heard of ſince. The fourteenth were Menoriſts, ſo called of one <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor</hi> a <hi>Friſian,</hi> by whoſe name for a certain time they were generally called. Theſe differed not in doctrines from the reſt, no more then did the <hi>Muncerians</hi> and <hi>Hutites.</hi> Some were founded, as I have ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, upon ancient hereſies; ſome of them hold the ſame opinions with the reſt, but have added more to them.

                     </note> that baptized himſelfe daily if the weather were temperate.

                  <p>It is not neceſſary to be injoined in ſo many words, becauſe there is ſufficient warrant for it, by bearing a proportion with cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion, the ſign being only changed. In many ſuch caſes the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ſilent, leaving men to draw conſequences of practice from generall propoſitions. As for example, when Chriſt ſaith, except a man be born again, doth he not mean a woman as well as man? or becauſe he ſaid only to his Diſciples at his laſt ſupper (where there was no woman preſent) Do ye this in remembrance of me, may we not therefore give the Communion to women without a ſpecial war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, I ſuppoſe no wiſe man will ſay ſo.

                     </note> In ſin my mother conceived me, ſaith, that for this cauſe the Church received a tradition from the Apoſtles, to baptize children.

So St <hi>Cyprian</hi> about the year 250. affirmed that children might be baptized before the eighth day. And the <hi>Milevitane</hi> Councill de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed ſuch to be accurſed, that denied children baptiſme, eſpecially if ſick, or in danger of death.

                  <p>This is indeed one of their tenets, but ſurely to baptize with (though not in) water, in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghoſt, cannot be denied to be true baptiſme; the waſhing, ſprinkling, or drenching, is but the circumſtance only; and therefore one may fully and rightly be baptized without dipping, as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſhewed you from the originall word,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Yes, for about the year 250. after Chriſt, ſome taught that all that were baptized by Hereticks, ought to be rebaptized by the Orthodox Miniſters of the Church; and their reaſon was, becauſe Hereticks themſelves had no part in the Church, and therefore could give no baptiſme.<note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> Of this opinion was St <hi>Cyprian,</hi> a Biſhop of <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thage</hi> in <hi>Africa,</hi> martyred in the daies of the Emperour <hi>Valerian,</hi> who beheaded him.

<pb n="181" facs="tcp:37858:109"/>by calling a Synod at <hi>Rome</hi> againſt it, which concluded that ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the tradition and cuſtome of the Church, hereticks, and thoſe that were baptized by them, might be received into the Church upon ſubmiſſion and recantation of their errors without rebaptizing.

                     </note> though St <hi>Cyprian</hi> is reported to have recanted his, which they might wel do, if they would diſtinguiſh of hereticks; for ſome hereticks deſtroied the foundation of faith, as the Samoſatenians, who ſaid that Chriſt was not of the ſubſtance of the Father, but called the Son of God, only for his ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. So the <hi>Arrians,</hi> who denied the conſubſtantiality and coeterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Chriſt with the Father, and ſuch as did deprave the form of bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſaying, I baptize thee in the name of the Father, by the Son,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Again, another error roſe up about the year 380.<note place="margin">Donatus.</note> by <hi>Donatus</hi> and his diſciples. <hi>Donatus</hi> was Biſhop of <hi>Numidia,</hi> and held, that the true Church was only among thoſe in <hi>Africa</hi> that held with him, contrary to that univerſall donation which God gave to Chriſt by promiſe, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.

                  <p>I ſhall prove that ſuch ſet forms may be in the Church. 1. By Scriptures. 2. Antiquity. And 3. By reaſon. 1. By Scriptures.<note place="margin">Liturgy proved law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full.</note> God ſet a form of bleſſing the people, <hi>Num.</hi> 6.23.

And therefore the Church may imitate God in this, ſhe having the ſpirit of ſupplication poured upon her, though ſuch forms be not indited to her by immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion.
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:37858:110"/>Beſide, we find in Scriptures, that holy men of themſelves did without any preſcription from God, ſet down forms of praier and praiſes, as <hi>Moſes, Num.</hi> 10.35, 36. and <hi>David</hi> ſet Pſalms to be ſung at certain times, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 92. a ſong for the Sabbath day, and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 102. is a Pſalm for the afflicted. So we find ſome called Pſalms of degrees, which they ſung when the Prieſts went up the ſteps to the Temple. This they did, and yet no doubt could pray by the ſpirit alſo. In the New Teſtament alſo,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyp.</hi> de orat. dom.</note> Chriſt not only ſet us a rule to pray by, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. but as a form to uſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. <hi>When ye pray, ſay our Father,</hi> &amp;c.

                  <p n="2">2. It may be proved by antiquity, and modern hiſtory, that the Churches from the Apoſtles, had ſet forms, that they might with one mind, and one mouth glorifie God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. And ſome think that the form of ſound words committed to <hi>Timothy,</hi> was ſome ſymbole of faith, or form of Liturgy. But however it is plain, that in the firſt hundred yeers,<note place="margin">Victorinus Sciaticus <hi>in praef. Laturg.</hi> Clem <hi>in Epi. ad Corinth.</hi> Hegeſippus.</note> both the Greek and Latine, Eaſt and Weſt Church had ſet forms, which ſome write they received from the Apoſtles.

So likewiſe in the next age we find, that the Chriſtians met every Lords day, and had certain ſelect places of ſcripture read to them, and had common praiers, beſide the miniſters particular conceived praier, and alſo ſung Pſalms. So <hi>Ignatius</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the <hi>Magneſians</hi> (an Epiſtle generally confeſſed to be his) ſaith,<note place="margin">Iuſt Mart. <hi>apol.</hi> 2. <hi>ad.</hi> Antoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num <hi>Imperat.</hi>

This man ſuffered martyrdome in the year 107. after Chriſt. And as in the former times they had their common praiers,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And farther, the Councill of <hi>Laodicea,</hi> about 368. called after the death of <hi>Jovinian</hi> the Emperor, ſet down rules that one and the ſame ſervice ſhould be uſed morning and evening. And when ſome began to make uſe of <hi>extempore</hi> praiers of their own, and left the common forms, then the Milevitane Councill aſſembled afterward in the raign of <hi>Arcadius,</hi> about ſome 400 years after Chriſt, whereof St <hi>Auſtin</hi>

He having occaſion to leave <hi>France,</hi> came to <hi>Geneva,</hi> which City had lately been abandoned by the Biſhop and Clergy thereof, for fear of the people who began to riſe againſt the popiſh religion there. Their civill government was by Magiſtrates choſen yearly by the people; and for Church-government they had then agreed upon none: but they choſe <hi>Calvin</hi> for their Preacher, and Divinity Lecturer. He with two other Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, perſwaded with ſome ado, the people to bind themſelves ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly by oath. Firſt, never to admit Popery again. And ſecondly, to obey ſuch orders, in the exerciſe of Religion, as himſelfe and the other two had contrived according to the Word of God.

And becauſe <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin</hi> and the other two Miniſters would not adminiſter the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to thoſe that denied quiet obedience, according to their oath; thoſe three, <hi>Calvin</hi> and his two aſſociats were baniſhed the Town; but within a few years they called him in again. He told them, that if he undertook to be their Paſtor, they muſt admit a compleat form of Church Diſcipline, and ſhould be ſworn for ever to obſerve it. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was, that there ſhould be an Eccleſiaſticall Court erected, which ſhould be alwaies ſtanding, that ſhould conſiſt of one Clergy man cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and two Lay men annually choſen, which ſeemed much to content the people, they being alwaies to have the more voices; but <hi>Calvin</hi> knew that the Miniſters had ods enough, having both art, lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and the tongue of perſwaſion. At laſt the people many of them diſliked it, and thought it no better then popiſh tyranny, and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned that <hi>Calvin</hi> had done all this to pleaſe his fantaſy; as <hi>Apelles,</hi> that

They of <hi>Geneva</hi> ſent to the <hi>Helvetian</hi> Churches, for their judgement in <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vins</hi> diſcipline, and whether they might better change then hold it. It was anſwered, that their ordinances were godly, and enclined toward the Scripture; and that they were better to hold them, then to change; ſo Mr <hi>Calvins</hi> diſcipline was accepted. And as his name grew fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, ſo was his diſcipline taken up by the <hi>French</hi> reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, and <hi>Scotland;</hi> and by ſome exalted in their Sermons ſo high, that they have ſaid, that a Miniſter with his Elderſhip, hath power given from God to excommunicate even Kings and Princes. <hi>Beza</hi> and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> hath canvaſed this point of diſcipline. The firſt ſaith, that excommunication is a moſt neceſſary diſcipline; and <hi>Eraſtus</hi> denieth the neceſſity of Lay Elders, to be Miniſters thereof. By others it hath been cried up for the Lords diſcipline,<note place="margin">Mart. Marpr. <hi>in l.</hi> 3. <hi>p.</hi> 8.</note> yea, and that all Chriſtian Churches ought to receive it, whether the governors of it will or not.

                     <hi>It ſeemeth that</hi> Calvins <hi>diſcipline aimed at a parity of Clergy and Laitie, which is the fourth point held by the Anabaptiſts, of which I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire your judgement.</hi>

                  <p>Calvin did indeed make them equall in cenſuring others by his diſcipline, but not as the Anabaptiſts do; for they would have no diſtinction between Clergy and Lay-men, no, not in exerciſing the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſteriall office, but that all men perform it that will, if gifted. But God hath diſtinguiſhed them, as he did <hi>Aaron</hi> from the Levites, and the Levites from the Laity: yea, before the Law there was that di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction; <hi>Melchiſedech</hi> was the Prieſt of the high God; and it ſeems very nature taught it; for <hi>Jethro</hi> was Prieſt of <hi>Midian:</hi> And Egypt had Prieſts too, diſtinct from other men. And Chriſt ſaid to his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, go (yee) and teach all nations. And St <hi>Paul</hi> doth plainly diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the Paſtor and flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. and ſaith, they that are taught ſhould communicate to the teacher, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. for all the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy muſt not be an eie or tongue. Methinks the judgement that God
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:37858:111"/>hath ſhewed upon men uſurping that office, ſhould be enough to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince the evill of this opinion, as upon <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram, Numb.</hi> 16.31.

Againſt whom St <hi>Bernard</hi> ſpeaks well, ſaying, They become maſters of the unlearned before they have been ſchollers of the learned; and ſo are more ready to ſpeak, then to hear, and apt to teach that they never learned, and pour out, before they have any thing poured into them. It is true, that it is prophecied, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.28. I will pour out my ſpirit upon all fleſh, yet that was not meant upon all alike; for when it was fulfilled in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.15. it was not given to all, but to the Apoſtles only: yet there was under the Goſpell a greater meaſure of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge given to teachers and hearers, then under the Law, yet it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth not that all ſheep ſhould be ſhepherds. So we read of ſome extraordinarily called, as <hi>Amos</hi> was an Herdſman; but ſuch things cannot be brought into ordinary imitation, no more then ſouldiers can expect to batter down wals with rams horns, or rout their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies with breaking of pitchers, as <hi>Gideon</hi> did the <hi>Midianites.</hi> But if Anabaptiſts calling to preach, be ordinary, let them prove it by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; if immediate from God, by a miracle.</p>

Beſide, we find God to abet magiſtrates both by his title given to them, Gods, and alſo by his providentiall preſence among them, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 82.1, 6. and by his direction of them in the execution of their office, ſaying, you judge not for man, but for the Lord, who is with you in judgement, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.6, 7.

And beſide, we find the authority of Magiſtrates, though heathens, eſtabliſhed by the Goſpell, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. and Chriſtians charged to pray for them, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.1. and therefore certainly their office is lawfull, ſince we muſt pray for them, that we may live a god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and a peaceable life in all godlineſſe and honeſty. And therefore much more may Chriſtians have, and pray for their proper magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates;<note place="margin">Pſal. 2.</note> and Chriſtian men may entertain the office of a magiſtrate, and be not only ſubject to Chriſts ſcepter, but alſo may be a great means to advance the Kingdome of Chriſt. And though Chriſt ſay my Kingdome is not of this world, yet he means only that his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is ſpirituall, ruling in the hearts of men, or glorious in heaven, not on earth; not by that ſpeech intending that Kings ſhould have no temporall government, no more than he intends that Chriſtians ſhould have neither houſes nor lands, becauſe the Foxes had holes, and the birds had neſts, but he had not where to lay his head. And what though Chriſt refuſed to be made a King, ſo to be a Judge be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween brethren, nor to condemn the woman taken in adultery, yet thoſe acts of Chriſt warrants no man to refuſe magiſtracy. For firſt, Chriſt refuſed to be made a King, becauſe the Meſſiah Kingdome was
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:37858:112"/>not to be temporall; and alſo becauſe <hi>Iudea's</hi> Kingdome by Gods permiſſion, was ſwallowed by the <hi>Roman</hi> conqueſt, and turned into provinces. Likewiſe if he had accepted of it, the people had no power to perform it, but he had made himſelfe and them guilty of ſedition, and ſo brought ſcandall upon the Goſpell, and the peoples lives to danger, if not deſtruction. Beſide, he came to be as a ſervant, not a King, and therefore in accepting Kingſhip, he had overthrown his own deſign: ſo he refuſed to judge between the two brethren,<note place="margin">Luke 12.13.</note> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was not called thereunto; for ſaith he, who made me a judge, or a divider; not but that it was a bleſſed office to make peace, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.9. and warrantable enough to end controverſies, in St <hi>Pauls</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. But Chriſt was not ſent to that end, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to do it, teaching us miniſters eſpecially to follow our calling, and all men not to meddle in ſecular affairs without lawfull commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And again, he refuſed to judge the woman taken in adultery. Firſt to avoid the Phariſees ſnare laied to catch him, either as a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temner of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, if he had not concluded her worthy of death, or a uſurper of Judicature, if he had authoritatively condemned her; he therefore evades it, by putting them in mind of their own ſins. I know ſome of them do farther object, that we read of none in the New Teſtament that took ſecular offices upon them, yet that will not prove there was none. It is ſufficient that we read of men in great of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice called to Chriſtianity, and yet do not read that they left their of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices for all that, but as St <hi>Paul</hi> adviſeth, that every man continue in that wherein he was called; as the Eunuch, <hi>Nicodemus, Theophilus</hi> a great man of <hi>Antioch, Publius</hi> the governor of <hi>Malta, Sergius Paulus</hi> the Deputy of <hi>Paphos, Eraſtus</hi> the Chamberlaine: But if there were none ſuch to be found, yet Chriſt ſubjecting himſelf to <hi>Caeſars</hi> tribute, and <hi>Pilates</hi> judgement, argueth magiſtracy lawfull enough. To con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm you farther herein, you may obſerve the practice of magiſtracy, and the approbation of the office in the Confeſſions and Articles of all Chriſtian Churches.</p>

But he had poiſoned ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny which proved Separatiſts, not only from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and all other reformed Churches, but even one from another, as the two <hi>Johnſons</hi> did;<note place="margin">Prophane Schiſmat. <hi>p.</hi> 60.</note> the younger libelling upon the Elder in print, with many opprobries; the elder curſed his brother and father with all the curſes of Gods book. This ſeparation they confirmed with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communications, nor would <hi>Francis</hi> be reconciled to his father at his death, but ſent him even to his grave with the curſe. Theſe in their ſeparation agree with the old <hi>Donatiſts,</hi> and new <hi>Anabaptiſts,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that they be only the true Church, and that the Goſpell is preached no where, nor by any truly but themſelves, and therefore will receive the Communion with no other; and they that have gifts may preach; and that in the Church there ought to be a parity; and will not ſerve God in Churches, becauſe they have been defiled with Popery; as if the Babyloniſh garment, and the gold of <hi>Jericho,</hi> may not be conſecrate to God, though it have been to an Idoll, ſince the earth is the Lords, and the fulneſſe thereof. We are by nature worſe then any Church can be made, yet God accounts us holy when we are dedicated to him. St <hi>Paul</hi> did not think himſelfe the worſe defiled, becauſe he ſailed in the ſhip called <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> two of the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens gods.

They be extreme virulent railers upon our Church and all her Rites; ſo you may know their ſpirit by their tongues, and from whence it is fiered.

                  <p>Papiſts when they were in authority they perſecuted the Church, when they were ſuppreſt,<note place="margin">Papiſts.</note> then ſecretly they corrupt the Church. By Papiſts I mean not the old before the <hi>Trent</hi> Councill (or rather Conventicle) begun in the year 1546. in the time of Pope <hi>Paulus</hi> the third, though they were bad enough, but the Papiſts that ſprung up ſince, becauſe they have brought in new errors, as other new Sectaries have done. As 1. Concerning free will, that it works by it ſelfe with grace in our converſion, though the Apoſtle ſaith, that the naturall man receiveth not the things of God. 2.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.14.</note> They ſay ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall ſin is quite taken away in baptiſme, ſo that it ceaſeth to be ſin,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:37858:114"/>yet St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that when he doth that which is evill, it is by ſin that dwelleth in him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.17. So they hold, that the certainty of ſalvation depends only upon hope, not on faith, contrary to <hi>John</hi> 1.12. ſaying, Chriſt gave them power to be made the ſons of God that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved on his name. They ſay the merit of Chriſts death and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is our ſatisfaction, not our righteouſneſſe; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith he was made to us righteouſneſſe, and made ſin for us, that we might be made the righteouſneſſe of God in him. So they ſay we are juſtified by a generall faith of apprehenſion, by which we beleeve the Scriptures to be true; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, by a particular faith of application of Chriſt and all his merits to our ſelves, as <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. who died for me, and gave himſelfe for me. So they ſay a man is not juſtified by faith alone, but by other vertues; but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith we are juſtified by faith with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the deeds of the Law; for indeed good works do but juſtifie our faith, not us; nor do they juſtifie us as a cauſe, but are ſigns and fruits of our juſtification. So they ſay a man may merit at Gods hands, becauſe God hath promiſed to reward us, and Chriſt hath deſerved that out works ſhould merit; but <hi>Paul</hi> refuſeth all for Chriſts merits, and deſireth only to be found in him, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.9. and not in his own righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe. So they ſay that Chriſt hath ſatisfied for our ſins, and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall puniſhment belonging to them, but the temporall we muſt ſatisfie in this world, or in purgatory. It is true, we muſt ſatisfie men for wrongs done, this is but a civill ſatisfaction. So we muſt fatisfie the Church by ſome teſtimony of repentance, if we have offended the Church, but we know of none we can make to God, but only in Chriſt: and for purgatory after life, we find none in Scripture, but beleeve as death leaves us, ſo judgement finds us. So they talk much of traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to be beleeved as neceſſary to ſalvation, becauſe the Apoſtle bids the Theſſalonians to hold faſt the traditions which they had been taught,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.14.</note> whether by word, or by our Epiſtle. But then they ought to prove to us, that the traditions which they would have us receive, are ſuch as were delivered of Chriſt to his Apoſtles, or from the Apoſtles to the Church;<note place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> or elſe give us leave only to hold, that the Scriptures alone hold forth to us all things neceſſary to ſalvation. So they hold vowes of things not commanded, are a part of Gods worſhip; ſuch as is a vowed ſingle life, wilfull poverty, and blind regular obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, which deſtroy Chriſtian Liberty; and therefore till they prove ſuch things commanded in Scripture, they muſt give us leave to hold only our vow in baptiſme, and to reject the other as humane inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of ſeducing ſpirits, ſpoken againſt, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.1, 2, 3. So they hold the worſhipping of images to be a religious work; but that is forbidden in the ſecond Commandement, which they have taken away and divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the tenth into two,<note place="margin">Paſcha Rauber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus <hi>firſt ſets it forth</hi> in lib de Corp.

                     </note> the better to bring the people to image-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipping. So they hold Chriſt to be bodily preſent in the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Bread and Wine; a ſtrange opinion, which was at firſt but at School-Queſtion; afterward maintained by tales and fictions of Chriſt appearing in the Sacrament like a little child. A ſhamefull opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion to ſubject Chriſt to orall eating, and gutturall ſwallo wing. True it is that Chriſt is really there preſent in a ſpirituall and myſticall
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:37858:114"/>manner in a Sacramentall relation to the ſigns, and by faith to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving receivers: yet I know the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath peremptorily condemned them for hereticks, that would not hold the bodily pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. For Pope <hi>Leo</hi> the ninth, and <hi>Victor</hi> the ſecond, and <hi>Nicolaus</hi> the ſecond, called Councils againſt <hi>Berengarius,</hi> who had diſproved it by <hi>Aug.</hi> and <hi>Scotus.</hi> Yet Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third in his Conventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of <hi>Lateran,</hi> gave it the name of Tranſubſtantiation, and ratified the doctrine thereof, and hath been the deſtruction of many a godly Martyrs life, in the time of Queen <hi>Mary.</hi> So they call the Lords Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per a ſacrifice, which they call the Maſſe, and it ſerves for the quick and dead with them. But it is not properly ſo called, but only as it is a memoriall of Chriſts offering up himſelfe, or becauſe then we do in Chriſt offer up our ſelves a living ſacrifice, or becauſe we make an offering at that time for the Miniſter and the poor. So they make fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting it ſelfe a part of Gods worſhip,<note place="margin">Rom. 14.17.</note> whereas the Kingdome of God conſiſteth not in meat or drink, nor in faſting from it, though tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance is a good vertue in a Chriſtian; but to ſet up a neceſſity of formall faſting, as a piece of Religion; or to ſet faſting in abſteining from fleſh for conſcience ſake, and yet at the ſame time to eat that which is far more delicious, is meer hypocriſie; yet we agree in the end of faſting, that it is profitable to make the ſoule more attentive in Gods ſervice, that the rebelliouſneſſe of our fleſh may be ſubdued, and to profeſſe our unworthineſſe of Gods creatures, and to teſtifie in humiliation for the averſion of judgements, which we either feele or fear. So they teach that a man may not only do all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements of God, but alſo do more than they require, which they call works of ſupererrogation. But it is ſaid, that by nature we are not ſubject to the law, neither indeed can be;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.7.</note> and by grace we cannot do it of our ſelves, but Chriſt is the end of the Law to them that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve; and ſo we do the law only by faith in Chriſt,<note place="margin">Gal. 2.16.</note> and thereby are juſtifi'd. Again, they adore and worſhip Saints, and yet they know not what knowledge the Saints have of them.<note place="margin">Iſa. 63.16.</note> 
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> is ignorant of us, and <hi>Iſrael</hi> doth not acknowledge us, ſaid <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> We may have a reverend remembrance of them, and give God thanks for their pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns and lights of godlineſſe to us, and we ought to imitate their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples; but to give them civill worſhip now they are abſent, is ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleneſſe, and to give them religious worſhip, is idolatry. I know they pretend they intercede for us, and preſent mens praiers to God, which if it could be proved, it might perſwade ſome men to give them a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition in ſpeciall, as to a Kings favourite to prefer our ſuits. But we know of no mediator between God and man, but the man Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. So they ſay that if one beleeve the generall points of faith, it is enough; we are for the doctrins built thereupon, to believe as the Church believes, which beliefe is called implicit faith. It is true, that at firſt we do aſſent to truth out of reſpect and regard to the Church that relates it; as the Samaritans did believe at firſt for the womans ſake, but at laſt for Chriſts ſake. So they hold praying for the dead,<note place="margin">John 4.42.</note> becauſe they hold alſo there is a purgatory, where men are purged by pains, which ſatisfie for veniall ſins, and for their temporall puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:37858:115"/>of their mortall ſins. But we know of but one ſatisfaction for ſin, the leaſt of which we cannot be freed from but by the infinite me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: therefore no particular man being dead, can lawfully be praied for, becauſe he is determined of God in his condition. So they hold the Pope ſupreme over all cauſes and perſons, Kings and Biſhops, and all becauſe he was they ſay, <hi>Peters</hi> ſucceſſor; yet <hi>Peter</hi> was not Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> and ſo his ſucceſſion is ſurreptitious; nor would the Greek Church ever acknowledge the Pope of <hi>Rome</hi> to be ſupreme, but only the Biſhop of the chiefe See, becauſe <hi>Rome</hi> was the imperiall City. So they ſay that Sacraments do not only repreſent to us Chriſt and his benefits, and inſtruments whereby God conveies them to us, but alſo that they have a phyſicall force to give grace; and alſo that the very adminiſtration giveth grace as it is a work done, which doth much invade Gods prorogative. So they make repentance a meritorious cauſe of remiſſion of ſin; but how can a temporall penance, or a finite ſorrow merit for an infinite tranſgreſſion; let them ſhew that, and they ſhall make many an <hi>Eſau</hi> glad, and a ſullen <hi>Ahab</hi> to rejoice.</p>
                  <p>The next turbulent people are the Papiſts called Jeſuits.<note place="margin">Jeſuits.</note> Their order began in the time of Pope <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rban</hi> the fift. Their patron or founder, was <hi>Ignatius Loyala,</hi> a Spaniſh ſouldier; they pretend to Viſions and Revelations, like the Anabaptiſts, and ſay that the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin <hi>Mary</hi> appeared to this <hi>Ignatius</hi> with Jeſus in her arms, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded him to erect this order, upon which it ſeems they call them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Jeſuites, though they ſupplant his Goſpell whereſoever they come. This order was confirmed by Pope <hi>Paul</hi> the third; and Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the thirteenth gave them a place in <hi>Rome</hi> to build them a Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legde, which coſt a vaſt ſum of monie.<note place="margin">Some ſay 25 tun of gold.</note> They have a Governor cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led their Generall, who hath power to command them what he pleaſe, and they reſpect his commands as divine oracles, and to ſend abroad his Emiſſaries, who transform themſelves like <hi>Proteus,</hi> into all ſhapes of profeſſions to do miſchiefe.

                  </p>
                  <p>Another diſturber of the Churches peace in theſe latter times, were the Familiſts,<note place="margin">Familiſts.</note> whoſe patron or founder was <hi>David George</hi> of <hi>Delfe,</hi> who called himſelfe <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Bridges,</hi> and affirmed that he was the true

                     <hi>David</hi> that ſhould reſtore the Kingdome to <hi>Iſrael.</hi> That the Scriptures were only to keep men in order till his comming, but he was able by his doctrine to ſave thoſe that would beleeve him; and that he was the right Meſſias, and that the ſpirit of Chriſt was given to him; and that the Church of Chriſt muſt not be built up by patience and ſuffering, but meekneſſe and love; and that whoſoever ſpoke againſt his doctrine, ſhould never be forgiven. He died in <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1556. though he had promiſed he ſhould never die. After him appeared <hi>Henry Nicolas,</hi> born at <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtelrodam</hi> in <hi>Holland,</hi> who maintained the ſame doctrine in his own name.

He made himſelfe a greater light then Chriſt, and ſaid that in his light Chriſt was perfected; and that he was codeified in God, and God hominified in him, and this they count the everlaſting Goſpell ſpoken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 11.15. They ſaid the ſpeech of Chriſt was made good in <hi>H.N.</hi> I muſt walk to day and to morrow,<note place="margin">Luke 13.32.</note> and the third day I ſhall be perfected; that is, by to day is meant the time of Chriſt; by to morrow the time of the Romiſh Religion, and by the third day the time of <hi>H.N.</hi> and his Family.

Alſo that it is lawfull to do whatſoever the higher power commands, though it be againſt Gods command. Herein they perform blind obedience like Papiſts, and the Jeſuits Novices. If a man do ſo, how doth he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:37858:116"/>his father and mother for Chriſt. Or why ſaid the Apoſtles to the higher powers, that it was more fit to obey God then man. So they affirm, that in ſaying God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghoſt, we acknowledge three Gods; not perceiving we call them ſo, becauſe they are all but one God in eſſence,<note place="margin">1 John 5.7.</note> though three diſtinct per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Here they ſmell of the old hereſie of Noetians, that held there was but one perſon in the Godhead, as the Socinians do now. They ſay there is no other heaven nor hell, than in this world among us. What place then is that to which Chriſt is gone before to prepare for us? or that fire foretold of Chriſt, into which wicked men muſt depart? So that they are not bound to give alms but to their own Sect, yet St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, do good to all. So that there ought to be no contrary both to the Law and Goſpell practice in all ages; that there was a world before <hi>Adams</hi> time: this is to be wiſe above what is written. So that they ought not to bury their dead, becauſe it is ſaid, let the dead bury their dead;<note place="margin">Mat. 8.22.</note> which he ſpake not as to have the dead neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, nor deſpiſing thoſe that did that charitable work, but to warn him that he out of too much care of worldly ceremonies, neglect not the bleſſed ſtate of life, to which Chriſt called him, ſaying, follow me. Alſo, that they need not ſay <hi>Davids</hi> praiers, becauſe they have no ſin; but St <hi>John</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">1 John.</note> ſuch deceive themſelves, and the truth is not in them.</p>
                  <p>But farther, they have blaſphemous opinions concerning God; as that God hath no other Deity in himſelfe, but ſuch as men partake of in this life.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> Indeed we are ſaid to partake of the divine nature, but that is not by the participation of equality, but of quality, both of grace and glory, not of the divine eſſence, but the holy diſpoſition or conditions thereof. So they hold that Chriſt is not a perſon God and man, but an eſtate or condition in men, common to them only who have received the doctrine of <hi>Henry Nicholas.</hi> So they ſay that <hi>Adam</hi> was all that God was, and God all that <hi>Adam</hi> was, as if God commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his whole eſſence to <hi>Adam</hi> as to Chriſt, which no man can well beleeve. Again, they would have none baptized till they be thirty yeers old. Indeed Chriſt was not, nor could not till there was one ſent to baptize (namely) <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. They ſay there was no truth preached ſince the Apoſtles times; yes, even that which they have often heard, but perverted, becauſe they did not entertain it in a love thereof, and ſo God hath given them up to deluſions. So they affirm, that the reſurrection of the body is only a riſing from ſin and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. But St <hi>John</hi> tels us of another,<note place="margin">Rev. 20.5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.6. as well as St <hi>Paul</hi> in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. They account marriage whoredome, where the parties married have not true faith.

That the morall Law is of no uſe to beleevers, not ſo much as a rule of life or examination, and yet Chriſt preacheth it and preſſeth it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. and more cloſely then ever it was before, even to rectifie the ſpirit and paſſions, as well as the outward manners. So they ſay that it is as poſſible for Chriſt to ſin, as a child of God. But as Chriſt did never ſin, ſo now being glorified, it is impoſſible he ſhould: but we have ſinned, and though regenerate, yet ſo long as we carry about this body of fleſh, in ſome things we ſhall offend, but not to condemnation. So they ſay that a child of God ought not to ask pardon for ſin, and it is blaſphemy ſo to do. But I will truſt Chriſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, who taught us to ſay, <hi>Forgive us our treſpaſſes;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Vid. <hi>Cypr.</hi> in Dom. Orat.</note> and will imitate <hi>David</hi> who did ask God forgiveneſſe, as you find <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. So they ſay God doth not chaſten any of his children for ſin, but yet ſin is the moving cauſe, and ſubject of Gods puniſhments, though not alwaies the finall cauſe of Gods chaſtiſements, but rather for probation of faith and patience. If theſe doctrins were true, theſe men may ſin by authority, and no conſcience being made of ſin, who would deal with them but upon good ſecurity? Theſe doctrins ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſo eaſie a way to heaven, it is no wonder but they have many followers: For they ſay that in converſion, a mans ſoule hath no operations, but the ſpirit of God only inſtead of them, yet Chriſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his diſciples underſtandings to apprehend the Scriptures, <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.45. So they ſay that the ſoul may be united with Chriſt, and yet he an hypocrite, yet he that hath the new man, is created in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and true holineſſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.24. So they ſay that a man muſt take no notiee of ſin or repentance, yet <hi>David</hi> doth, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. Alſo that it is a damnable error to make ſanctification an evidence of juſtification, yet St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith otherwiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1.30. namely,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Vid.</hi> Mr. <hi>Wels</hi> his tract.</note> that ſuch walk after the ſpirit, and thoſe that are juſtified are glorified, <hi>i.</hi> ſanctified, which is the inchoation of glory.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That the Law or preaching of it, is of no uſe to drive us to Chriſt, yet <hi>Paul</hi> cals it a Schoolmaſter to that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That a man is juſtified without faith, and that from eternity, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, we are juſtified by faith, and ſo have peace with God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. We know God juſtifieth his people in his purpoſe from all eternity, but it is conveied to them in time actually by their faith.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That we are united to Chriſt by the work of the ſpirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any act of ours, yet <hi>Paul</hi> exhorts us to give up our ſelves to God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. and ſaith, that we work together with God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That a man is not Chriſts till he have full aſſurance, yet <hi>David</hi> ſometime was beſide the rock, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41. and <hi>Paul</hi> was buffeted, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.</p>
                  <p>And 5. That the witneſſe of the ſpirit is without any reſpect to the word, or concurrence with it. But then how ſhall I try the ſpirit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or bad? <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, beleeve not every ſpirit, then I muſt trie it, or elſe beleeve it or cenſure it without triall; and if I muſt try it, I muſt have a rule to try it by, and that muſt be the word, or nothing.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. When a man hath this witneſſe of the ſpirit, he never doubts, yet <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71.</p>
                  <p>And 7. Aſſurance muſt not be queſtioned, though one commit murder or adultery, yet <hi>David</hi> praied for the ſpirit after thoſe ſins committed, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. This doctrine will make a bold ſinner, and a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, inſurer of himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>So 8. They ſay that ſanctification is no evidence of a mans good eſtate, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith that holineſſe is the end of our calling, and if ſo, then holineſſe is an evidence that I am effectually called.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. They ſay that to ſee I have no grace, will give me comfort, yet St <hi>Paul</hi> finds no comfort, ſeeing in his fleſh he found no good thing, but rather crieth out upon himſelfe, O miſerable man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. yea, they ſay to take comfort at the ſight of any grace is legall; and yet grace came not by the Law, <hi>John</hi> 1. but by Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo it is evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall to find Goſpell grace in us, and to take comfort in it.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. They ſay that an hypocrite may have the ſame grace that <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> had in his innocency, yet moſt conclude that <hi>Adam</hi> was created in Gods image, which conſiſted in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe; which two qualities no hypocrite can have.</p>
                  <p>So 11. They ſay there is no difference between the graces of the Saints and hypocrites, yet <hi>Iob</hi> ſaith, the hope of the hypocrite is like the web of the ſpider, ſpun out of their own phantaſie, and eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, ſo is not the hope of the Saints, for it is woven out of Gods promiſes, which makes the Saints ſo ſettle upon an everlaſting foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation.</p>
                  <p>So 12. They ſay that all grace is in Chriſt, as in the proper ſubject of it, and that we have none in us, as if Chriſt beleeves, and Chriſt loves for us,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.5.</note> yet <hi>Paul</hi> finds faith in <hi>Timothy,</hi> and Chriſt ſuppoſeth love to be in his diſciples, when he ſaid, if you love me keep my Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dements, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.15.</p>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:37858:117"/>
                  <p>So 13. They ſay Chriſt is the new creature, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note> he that is in Chriſt is a new creature.</p>
                  <p>So 14. They hold that God loveth a man never the more for his holineſſe, nor the leſſe for his wickedneſſe; but <hi>Moſes</hi> tels us other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, ſaying, God had reſpect to <hi>Abels</hi> offering, not to <hi>Cains.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So 15. That ſin in a child of God muſt not trouble him; but ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then <hi>David</hi> might have ſaved much ſorrow expreſſed in his peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tential Pſalms; and Chriſts affirmation of the Angels rejoycing at a ſinners repenting, may be diſ-believed, for they rejoyce not at our doing amiſs.</p>
                  <p>So 16. Trouble of conſcience for ſin, ſhews one under the cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works; yet <hi>Paul</hi> commends godly ſorrow in the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 Cor. 7.9.</note> who were believers. But what if ſuch trouble of minde do argue one ſometimes under the ſpirit of bondage, or the law of works; yet this may be a means to make us ſigh the more after freedome, and doth commonly bring his children to <hi>Sion</hi> by <hi>Sinai,</hi> to freedome by bondage, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15.</p>
                  <p>So 17. They ſay a Chriſtian is not bound to take the Law as a rule of his converſation. But why did not then Chriſt aboliſh the Law, as well as fulfill it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.17. or why doth the Apoſtle ſay that he doth not by his preaching up faith to juſtifie a man,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> make void the Law, but eſtabliſh it? ſurely by accepting it for a rule of an holy life, though not either to juſtifie or condemn us, but to walk according to it out of love to righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.22.</p>
                  <p>Again 18. They ſay a man is not bound to pray, except the ſpirit moveth him, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, pray continually; and <hi>Peter</hi> bids us be ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and watch to praier, as if it were a duty; and if we look upon it as a duty, then we are to do it without expecting farther incitation by immediat infuſions. So they ſay that the ſpirit works in hypocrites by gifts and graces, but in Gods children immediatly: but then they need not take heed it ſeems to the ſure word of prophecy, as ſaith St <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> which he prefers for the Churches eſtabliſhment, before that of revelation, calling it a more ſure word of prophecy.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 18, 19.</note> So they pretend that a Miniſter that hath not this new light, cannot edifie them that have it. I wonder then how the Apoſtles edified the Church, who had not this new light, or dark lanthorn rather of vaine opinions; for I have ſhewed you that they are contrary to the Apoſtles doctrins: or if their light were the moſt ſaving grace of God, yet a man that hath it not may edify others, by preaching ſalvation to others, though himſelfe be a caſtaway. So they ſay no Chriſtian ought to be preſt to the duties of holineſſe. This is to make the world beleeve, that there is no need of preaching,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 4.2.</note> yet St <hi>Paul</hi> bids <hi>Timothy</hi> to preach in ſeaſon and out of ſeaſon; and <hi>Titus</hi> to rebuke and exhort with all au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.15.</p>

                  <p>The Arminians revived the hereſie of <hi>Pelagius Britto,</hi> who lived in the daies of the Emperours <hi>Arcadius</hi> and <hi>Honorius;</hi> who held that men by nature might fulfill the whole Law of God; and denied originall ſin, and ſaid that men were ſinners by imitation only
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:37858:118"/>of <hi>Adams,</hi> not by carnall propagation, contrary to <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. And that children had no need of baptiſme for remiſſion of ſin; and that the Godly men in Scripture that confeſſed their ſins, did it for example ſake, rather then out of guiltineſſe; whom St <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſufficiently confutes; and their tenets were condemned by the fift Councill of <hi>Carthage,</hi> in the year 419. as hereticall. Alſo by the Milevitane Councill in <hi>Numidia.</hi> The patron of the Arminians, was one <hi>Jacobus Arminius,</hi> profeſſor of Divinity at <hi>Leyden</hi> in the Low Countries, in the year 1605. his followers are called Remonſtrants. Now as <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagius</hi> being driven from <hi>Rome,</hi> came into <hi>England,</hi> and infected it with his errors, though by the travels of <hi>Germanus Altiſidorenſis,</hi> and <hi>Palladius,</hi> ſent hither by <hi>Caeleſtinus</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> the land was freed from his poiſon. So <hi>Arminius</hi> infected <hi>England</hi> by his writings, and his well-wiſhers, ſuch as <hi>Conradus Vorſtius,</hi> but was reaſonably well ſtopt by the diligence of King <hi>James,</hi> in ſending over certain learned and grave Divines, to the Synod of <hi>Dort.</hi> Yet nevertheleſſe theſe er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors have found many favourers in <hi>England,</hi> though they are againſt Scriptures, and the Articles of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As concerning prepeſtination, they deny it, by ſaying that it is only the will of God to ſave them that beleeve and perſevere, and that there is no other decree of election, contrary to <hi>Acts</hi> 13.48. as many as were ordained to eternall life beleeved; and <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. he hath choſen us to ſalvation before the foundation of the world. So <hi>Ro.</hi> 8.30. whom he hath predeſtinated, them he hath alſo called. So they ſay election is of faith, not of perſons, but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith God hath called us according to his purpoſe in Chriſt before the world. 4. That election of us to faith, preſuppoſeth in us honeſty and humility, and a diſpoſition to eternall life; whereas it is election that cauſeth ſuch vertues, and not they election:<note place="margin">Epheſ. 2.3, 4.</note> for by nature we are only given to fulfill the will of the fleſh, and are by nature the children of wrath as well as others, but God who is rich in mercy,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.11.</note> hath quickned us, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for election is not of works, but of him that calleth, for he loved us firſt, 1 <hi>John</hi> 4.10. So 5. They ſay election is not unchangeable, but a man may withſtand Gods decree;<note place="margin">Mat. 24.24.</note> but Chriſt ſaith, the elect cannot be ſeduced, for Chriſt loſeth not thoſe that are given to him, <hi>John</hi> 6.39. and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the chaine holds from election to glorification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. which certainly is the joy of Gods people, that their names are written in heaven, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.20. and therefore none can charge them nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn them, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33. So 6. They make election generall, which is a contradiction;<note place="margin">Rom. 9.18.</note> God hath mercy on whom he will. And to ſome it is given to know the myſteries of Chriſts Kingdome, not to others, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. to babes, and not to the worldly wiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.15, 16.</p>

                  <p>They ſay that the cauſe why God ſends his Goſpell to one people and not to another, is not only Gods good pleaſure, but becauſe one nation is more worthy then another,<note place="margin">Deu. 10.14, 15</note> yet <hi>Moſes</hi> told <hi>Iſrael</hi> that God choſe their fathers out of meer love: And Chriſt ſaid, that <hi>Cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>razin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida</hi> were a worſe people then thoſe of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 11.21.</note> So they ſay that God ordained Chriſt to die without any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:37858:118"/>determination of ſaving any particular man or people,<note place="margin">Iſa. 53.10.</note> yet <hi>Iſaiah</hi> ſaith, that when he ſhall make his ſoul an offering for ſin, that he ſhall ſee his ſeed. And Chriſt ſaith, I know my ſheep, and I lay down my life for my ſheep. So they teach that God did not intend to eſtabliſh a new Covenant of grace with man by Chriſts blood, but to make any covenant with man whatſoever, either of works or grace: But Chriſt is called the ſurety of a better eſtament than was before, <hi>viz.</hi> of works, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. whereby we are juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption of Chriſt. So they ſay that all are received into grace and favor alike, in the Goſpel-covenant, and none ſhall be condemned for originall ſin, and yet Chriſt ſaith, I pray not for the world, but for thoſe thou haſt given me out of the world. They ſay alſo that God confers equally the benefits of Chriſts death to men; but the cauſe why ſome men have them, and not others, is, by reaſon of their free will, chuſing it, and not of Gods ſingular gift of mercy, effectually working thereunto, yet St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, it is not in him that willeth, or runneth, but in God that ſheweth mercy. So they ſay Chriſt died not for thoſe whom God loved, and choſe to eternall life, becauſe they had no need of it. But they perceive not that they were choſen to ſalvation in Chriſt, not out of him, nor without him, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.4. And they forget that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid that he was loved, and yet Chriſt was given for him too, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. So they ſay that originall ſin is not ſufficient in it ſelfe to condemn all mankind, nor yet to deſerve tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall or eternall death; yet it is ſaid, that by one man ſin entred, and death paſſed upon all men; yea more, that the fault came upon all men to condemnation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12, 18. So they ſay that holineſſe and righteouſneſſe was not placed in mans will in his creation, and therefore he could not loſe it in his fall. But this is againſt Scripture, for <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.24. <hi>Paul</hi> doth parallel the new man to the old, and ſhewes that by Chriſt man regaineth what was loſt in <hi>Adam,</hi> righteouſneſſe and holineſſe. They ſay alſo that by ſpirituall death, no ſpirituall gift was ſeparated from the will, and therefore it being never corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted (if the underſtanding be enlightned) it can aſſume her freedome to chuſe or refuſe any good offred to it. It ſeems then our parents did not ſin willingly, ignorantly they could not, they knew the command: ſo then if neither willingly nor ignorantly, then they ſinned not at all. So they ſay a regenerate man is not dead in ſin, but can hunger after righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, yet St <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith otherwiſe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.1. you hath he quickned who were dead in ſins and treſpaſſes. They ſay alſo that a man may uſe the light of nature ſo well, that thereby he may obtain ſaving grace; but we know neither how grace can flow from nature, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may uſe the light of nature ſo well; nor how nature can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve grace, but is rather by divine diſpenſation; nor doth God effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caciouſly affoord to every man nor people alike the ſame means of faith and repentance, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.6. So they ſay, that God in mans converſion doth infuſe no new qualities or habits into his wil contrary to <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44.3. I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon thy off-ſpring; and he promiſeth a new heart,<note place="margin">Ezek. 36.26. Pſal. 51.</note> which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> praieth for. So they ſay, God only is a morall agent, perſwading
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:37858:119"/>to converſion, but the Church doth acknowledge his attractive pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1. draw me. So God ſaith by <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> that he will take away the ſtony heart, and change the condition of it. So they ſay that it is in mans power to be or not to be regenerate; for a man may reſiſt the power of Gods grace: but how then do we beleeve, according to the mighty working of his power, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. or how doth God fulfill all the pleaſure of his goodneſſe, and the work of faith with power, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.11. So they ſay that Gods grace in converſion doth not prevent or go before the act of mans will, but free will and grace are co-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers. But ſurely God hath preventing grace, as well as aſſiſting grace which a man receiveth, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. and which worketh in us to will and to do, before we have any inclination either to will or do.</p>
                  <p>But beſides all this, they do much erre in the doctrine of perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; for they ſay that perſeverance of the faithfull is not an effect of election, nor any gift of God purchaſed by the death of Chriſt, yet Chriſt makes it depend upon election, when he ſaith, that the Elect cannot poſſibly be deluded, and that he hath laied down his life for the ſheep, <hi>viz.</hi> that they might by patience and continuance in well doing, attain eternall life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.7. and ſo nothing might be laid to the charge of Gods elect: but they ſay the regenerate may totally and finally fall away from their juſtifying faith, and that ſome of them do ſo fall, that they periſh everlaſtingly; but if Chriſt died for us while we were yet ſinners, much more being juſtified by his blood, we ſhall be ſaved from wrath through him, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. for he that is born of God ſinneth not (<hi>i.</hi> to condemnation) becauſe Gods ſeed remaineth in him.<note place="margin">1 John 3 9.</note> So Chriſt giveth eternall life to his ſheep, and they cannot pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh, <hi>John</hi> 10.28. yet theſe men ſay, that one regenerate may ſin to death,<note place="margin">1 John 5.18.</note> yet St <hi>John</hi> denieth it, we know that whoſoever is born of God ſinneth not. <hi>i.</hi> that ſin unto death there ſpoken of. So they ſay that we cannot be certain of future perſeverance without revelation, yet St <hi>John</hi> teſtifieth, that we may know he abideth in us by the ſpirit which he hath given us, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.24. So they ſay that aſſurance of ſalvation makes men neglect godlineſſe, yet ſurely he that hath this hope puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fieth himſelfe the more, 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.2, 3. So they ſay that temporary faith, differeth not from juſtifying faith, but only in continuance; but yet Chriſt makes great difference of them, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. by their rooting and fructifying. So they think it ſtrange that a man ſhould be new born ſpiritually, as <hi>Nicodemus;</hi> but thoſe that are to be ſaved, are born anew,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.23.</note> not of corruptible ſeed, but incorruptible. So they teach that Chriſt never praied for the infallible perſeverance of the faithfull, yet Chriſt told <hi>Peter,</hi> that he had praied for him, that his faith fail not, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.32. So for his Diſciples, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.11. and not only for them, but for all that ſhould beleeve by their word, <hi>Iohn</hi> 17.20.</p>

It is a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of many hereſies, namely, of the Ebionites, Arrians, Photinians,
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:37858:119"/>Samoſatenians and Sabellians, Servetians, and Antitrinitarians. For after the execution of <hi>Servetus</hi> the Spaniard, who was burnt at <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va</hi> for his blaſphemy, 1553. in affirming that only God the Father was the true God, and that neither the Son nor the holy Ghoſt, is eternall God, but that the Son was a creature, and had his beginning of exiſtence when God created the world. Many ſucked up his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nome, as <hi>Valentinus Gentilis,</hi> who printed his blaſphemies, and called <hi>Athanaſius</hi> his Creed, Satanaſius Creed, who ſuffered death in the Town of <hi>Berne,</hi> yet he had ſome aſſociates in his bad opinions, as <hi>Geor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius Blandrata</hi> a Phyſitian, <hi>Matheus Gibraldus</hi> a Lawyer, and <hi>Paulus Alciatus.</hi> And in the year 1557. <hi>Laelius Socinus</hi> ſhewed himſelfe a favourer both of <hi>Servetus</hi> and <hi>Valentinus.</hi> He had by his Letters and travels done much harm in <hi>Poland</hi> and other places before, namely, from 1551. unto 1557. and ſo forward, though cloſely and ſubtilly enough, untill 1562. in which year he died about the age of 37. His Nephew <hi>Fauſtus</hi> fled out of <hi>Italy</hi> to <hi>Lyons</hi> in <hi>France</hi> (ſeeing that his Unckle <hi>Cornelius</hi> was apprehended) together with others, who have ſcattered his poiſon in the world, wrapt up in <hi>Laelius</hi> his notes.

                  <p>That there is no naturall knowledge leading a man to a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liefe of a Deity, contrary to <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, that the inviſible things of God are ſeen by things created, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.20. and that the Gentiles do by nature the things written in Gods law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.14. So they ſay Chriſt is not God, and yet they give him divine worſhip, and ſo make him an Idol, and themſelves Idolaters. So they deny the Godhead of Jeſus Chriſt, which forfeits their own Chriſtianity, and overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Chriſtian Religion, and all divine honour due to Chriſt from men. This was the hereſie of <hi>Samoſatenus,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Antiochia,</hi> of whom you have heard already. How can theſe men be called Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, who deny the office of Chriſt? No marvell though they refuſe to be baptized in the name of the Trinitie, if they denie with <hi>Sabellius</hi> two perſons in the Trinitie: for they ſay Chriſt is not trulie God,<note place="margin">Iohn 8.58.</note> yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, he was in the form of God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.6. and the character of his glorie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2. and in him dwelt the fulneſſe of the Godhead bodily, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9. So they ſay that the Holy Ghoſt is not God; and ſo <hi>Macedonius</hi> held, who was juſtlie condemned by the ſecond generall Council of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> in the year 386. But if the Holie Ghoſt be not God, why doth <hi>St. Iohn</hi> rank him as equall to the Father and Son, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.7. Again, they ſay the Incarnation of Chriſt is repugnant to reaſon, which I have formerlie diſproved; and that it is not fullie proved in Scripture, yet <hi>St Iohn</hi> tels us, that the Word became fleſh, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.14. So they ſay that Chriſt did not by his death ſatisfie for our ſins; yet it is ſaid that he is the propitiation for our ſins, and that is
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:37858:120"/>all one, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.2. So they ſay it is againſt Scripture to beleeve three perſons in the Godhead, and yet Chriſt inſtitutes baptiſme to be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the three names of Father, Son, and Holie Ghoſt. So they ſay man was not created in originall righteouſneſſe, yet <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, God made man upright, but he hath ſought inventions. So they ſay that the old Teſtament is not neceſſarie for a Chriſtian man, yet Chriſt ſaith <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpake of him, <hi>Iohn</hi> 5.46. and the men of <hi>Berea</hi> ſearched the old Teſtament to prove the truth of the new, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.11. Theſe are very dangerous errors, becauſe they overthrow the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Chriſtian faith, namely, Chriſts ſatisfaction for us, and plainlie Antichriſtian, in denying Chriſt to be God. And alſo they denie the perſon of the Holie Ghoſt. They confound faith and works together. They ſay the Law is imperfect, and yet that man is juſtified by the works of the Law, not by the law of faith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.27. Alſo, that the ſoule of man hath no ſubſiſtence after death, whereby it apprehendeth joy or ſorrowes; and ſo conſequently they may denie heaven and hell, as things only imaginarie. They ſtand much upon reaſon, and would ſubject not only Fathers and Councils, but alſo the Scriptures to it; and ſo every man doth like the Pope, in being the judge of all by his own reaſon. Beſide, they are tied in a knot with Arminians and Anabaptiſts, concerning the power of magiſtrates, and are one as law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe as the other. And the Papiſts are well pleaſed with them, becauſe they perceive them to do their work for them, in rooting out all Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Magiſtrates and Miniſters.</p>

                  <p>Such as are againſt the keeping of any Sabbath, whether the Jewiſh Sabbath, or the Chriſtians Lords day. Of which opinion was one <hi>Hetherington</hi> a Box-maker, who ſaid, not only the Jewes Sabbath day was of no force ſince Chriſts time, and the Apoſtles, but alſo taught that every day was a Sabbath, as much as the Lords day. But he recanted his error at <hi>Pauls</hi> Croſſe God be praiſed. And good reaſon; for though the Jewiſh Sabbath being but a ſhadow of Chriſt, be now aboliſhed, and we are not to be judged by the keeping of it,<note place="margin">Col. 2.16.</note> yet the morality of that Commandement is obſerved in keeping ſtill one day in ſeven holy to the Lord, for delivering us from the bondage of ſin by Chriſts reſurrection, as the Jewes kept theirs in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of their freedome from the bondage of Egypt, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. And thus the Law by the Chriſtians obſerving the firſt day of the week,<note place="margin">Rom. 3.31.</note> is not made void, but eſtabliſhed. It is true that there is no precept for the changing of it, becauſe there was no need; for the morall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Law, commanded only that one day in ſeven be kept; ſo that if the Patriarchs before the Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> kept a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day in reſpect to the creation; and the Jewes kept a ſeventh in reſpect of their liberation from Egypt, and the Chriſtians keep their ſeventh day in relation to Chriſts redemption, that Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement is fulfilled ſo far as it requireth an holy ſeventh day. And though we have no precept for changing, yet we have their practice and examples, who had the mind of Chriſt.

                  <p>There have been ſome long agoe, that held ſome of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions of old <hi>Pelagius. Britto</hi> the <hi>Welſh</hi> man, <hi>alias Morgan,</hi>

                     </note> who lived in the time of the Emperour <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, about the year 416. His followers of latter time are reckoned to hold many errors; as 1. That <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould have died by the courſe of nature, though he had not ſinned; yet we find that God joins death to diſobedience, <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.17. So 2. They ſay <hi>Adams</hi> ſin only hurt himſelfe, not his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie, yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith otherwiſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.12. by one man ſin entred, and death paſſed upon all men, becauſe all men did partake of that one ſin, yea, even thoſe that never ſinned, as <hi>Adam</hi> did, <hi>ver.</hi> 14. <hi>i.</hi> actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allie, but not originallie, as children have no ſin but that, and yet die.<note place="margin">Auguſt. Beza.</note> But therefore 3. Theſe Pelagians denie originall ſin in children; but how then ſaith <hi>David,</hi> in ſin my mother conceived me, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51. and therefore originall ſin is propagated by generation. 4. They ſay, the children of the faithfull, though not baptized, are ſaved, and they ſhall enjoy everlaſting life, but not in heaven; but Chriſt ſaith, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. that thoſe which belong to Gods Kingdome, muſt be baptized with water; nor doth the Scripture ſet forth to us any third place between heaven and hell. 5. They ſay that men are born in <hi>Adams</hi> perfection, ſtature and age excepted; yet ſure they are not born in ſuch integrity as <hi>Adam</hi> was made, for then all would be equally wiſe
<pb n="206" facs="tcp:37858:122"/>and good when they come to age. 6. They ſay men have free will by which they are enabled to do well without Gods grace; yet ſaith <hi>Paul,</hi> not I, but the grace of God in me. 7. Gods grace they ſay is obtained by the merit of our works; yet <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, that they that are in the fleſh cannot pleaſe God, and therefore by naturall works they cannot merit grace. 8. They ſay that the word grace in Scripture doth not ſignifie remiſſion of ſin, or donation of the Holy Ghoſt, but the doctrine of the Goſpell. But this is found otherwiſe: for as there is the doctrine of faith,<note place="margin">Fides quam credimus, &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des quâ cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dimus.</note> which is preached, <hi>Rom.</hi> 10.8. and the vertue of faith by which we beleeve it, and are thereby juſtified, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. So the promulgation of the Goſpell is a common grace afforded to many, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11. teaching us to denie ungodlineſſe; and next, by it is begot ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.14. the grace of our Lord was exceeding abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in me, with faith and love which is in Jeſus Chriſt. 9. They ſay that faith is the knowledge of the Law and the Hiſtorie, not any ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall work in us, but then the faith of divels and good Chriſtians are both alike, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.10. They ſay the Law is not impoſſible for a man to keep, and it is ſatisfied by the externall obedience; why then doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſay, that by the work of the Law no man can be juſtified? <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. yet he that can fulfill it may be juſtified by it, and hath no need of Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.12. So 11. They ſay that to pray for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of ſinners, or for the Saints perſeverance, is vain, becauſe it is in the power of their own free will. But ſurely the will of man hath not power to revive him, though he had power to kill himſelfe; and therefore praier is very fit to be uſed for people unconverted, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo for the godly becauſe of their frailties; therefore Chriſt bids us pray for our enemies; and <hi>Paul</hi> boweth his knees dailie for the <hi>Epheſians, c.</hi> 3.16. So 12. They ſlight the doctrin of predeſtination, which is applauded by St <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> and comfortable to Gods people. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other errors they hold, not worth relating.</p>

                  <p>Independants are thoſe that ſet up a congregationall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which ſhall depend upon no other Church, Synod nor Claſſis; and though they be againſt the Biſhops, yet they would have in every Church Biſhop-Independants; and ſo many Pariſhes, ſo many prelacies, becauſe they are Independant upon any other. They are bred from Separatiſts and Browniſts. The firſt of them that I can hear of, was one Mr <hi>Robinſon,</hi> who leaving <hi>Norwich,</hi> turned a rigid Browniſt at <hi>Leyden.</hi> He dying, many of his followers went from thence to <hi>New England,</hi> and planted at <hi>Plymoth</hi> there, and ſpread their errors by diſcourſe, and into old <hi>England</hi> by letters, where they endeavor to ſet Church againſt Church, and Conventicles againſt our Churches, which they call ſteeple-houſes, which were at firſt ſet up for the honour of God and his ſervice, though abuſed by the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts to ſuperſtition, yet are they never the worſe when they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to a right uſe; for as there is no inherent righteouſneſs in their wals, ſo neither is inherent ſuperſtition in them. It is true that <hi>Jehoſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phat</hi> took away the high places and groves, becauſe God had appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:37858:122"/>and a place was conſecrated for his ſervice,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 17.6.</note> and ſuch high places and groves were forbidden. But they juſt contrary to <hi>Jehoſaphat,</hi> pull down the conſecrated places, and ſet up high places in chambers, and meet in the groves and woods: God give them a right underſtanding in the uſe of Churches. Beſide this, they ſet themſelves to overthrow learning, and to rob it of all maintainance, and the miniſters of all dues, and yet ask, wherein have we robbed God? <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. where God anſwereth them, in tithes and offerings, which God thought a fit way to maintaine his Prieſts. And Chriſt bids the Leper go ſhew himſelfe to the Prieſt, and pay his offering, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.4. And <hi>Paul</hi> found it was equity, that as they which did wait on the Altar were partakers of the Altar; So that it was Gods Ordinance that they that preach the Goſpell ſhould live on the Goſpell, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13, 14. Yet theſe like <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate would rob the Church of maintainance, that there might be no miniſtrie, becauſe they deſpiſe prophecie. Again, they allow no ſet forms of Praier, no, not Chriſts form, and yet they will ſay St <hi>Pauls</hi> (namely) The grace of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the love of God the Father, and the fellowſhip of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Yet it hath ever been the practice of all true Churches, Jewes and Chriſtians, to have ſet forms, as well for the uniform conſent of the people, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.6. in praier and in praiſe, as alſo for the confining (not of the ſpirit as they ſuppoſe) but of their inconſiderate ſpirits to the words of truth and ſoberneſſe. Yet there was alwaies liberty enough to ſhew the gift of praier, before and after Sermon, if men could uſe their libertie, not as occaſion to fleſhly phantaſies.</p>

                  <p>I cannot deny but that the Prelaticall or Canonicall Miniſters have been of late about 1635. more ſtrict than formerly, about Church-order and Ceremonies. And the Presbyterian hath been more extream then needed, againſt the Prelatical miniſtrie, and Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copall government, ſince both of them agree in divine truths. God hath given them both a right to his houſe, but they quarrell who ſhould have the upper, or who the lower rooms, and both contend which of them ſhould keep the keies. The Lord make them of one heart, that the people may be freed of thoſe diſtractions, in which they are bred by their diſagreements. It were happy if all would take the counſell of <hi>Irenaeus</hi> to <hi>Victor</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> who did raſhly excommunicate the Eaſtern Churches for diſſenting from his judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in faſting and celebrating of Eaſter: For he told him they did all agree in one faith, and therefore it was more fit for him to ſtudy peace, unitie and love.

                  <p>As they were more ancient, that by them Presbyters might be ordained; ſo they were of more dignitie and authoritie then any meer Presbyters. This dignitie and authoritie the Apoſtles kept to themſelves a while; Firſt, becauſe as yet the Church was not ſetled. Secondlie, becauſe at firſt few or none were found fit for that office. But at laſt, leſt equalitie and paritie ſhould breed ſchiſme, they ſet up ſuperintendents or Biſhops,<note place="margin">Hieron. <hi>in</hi> Tit. <hi>c.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp; Ep. ad</hi> Evagri.</note> who did excell other Presbyters, both in conferring rewards, and alſo in cenſuring manners, as in <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.5. he had power to ordain.

                  <p n="1">1. For impoſition of hands, or confirmation, we find no Presbyter, nor any of the 72 Diſciples, to take that office upon him alone without the Apoſtle or Biſhop; and when they did ſo, they did it rather for approbation of the partie, then benediction. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore though <hi>Philip</hi> converted the <hi>Samaritans,</hi> and did miracles, yet <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>John</hi> were ſent to confirm them, <hi>Act.</hi> 8. ſo did S. <hi>Paul</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, Acts</hi> 19. which impoſition of hands was not alwaies the <hi>medium</hi> of conveying the gift of tongues, and doing miracles, but of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and comforting grace, and therefore called a fundamentall point of Chriſtianitie, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.2.</p>
                  <p>So 2. For ordination, we find it ſtill given by the Apoſtles, not by the Diſciples; therefore <hi>Acts</hi> 6. when the ſeven Deacons were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen, the Apoſtles laid their hands upon them (not any other of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples out of whoſe number they were taken) though they were now but only ordained Deacons of the Churches ſtock,<note place="margin">Concil. <hi>Conſt.</hi> in Trul. Can. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> not of the holy myſteries.</p>
                  <p>And 3. They had a full juriſdiction over the Church, <hi>John</hi> 20.21. as my Father ſent me, ſo ſend I you.<note place="margin">

<pb n="212" facs="tcp:37858:125"/>who might well be the firſt repreſentative Presbyters; but to the Apoſtles Chriſt ſpake this, from whom both Presbyters and Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons were to take their order, which if any man with the heretick <hi>Arrius</hi> will deny, then he muſt prove from whence Presbyters derive their order. From Chriſt they cannot, he made none of that name; if from the Apoſtles, then they muſt confeſſe it ſubordinate to the Apoſtles order ſet in the Church, or elſe they muſt confound Apoſtles and Presbyters together, contrary to St <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, all are not Apoſtles, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.29.</p>
                  <p>So 4. In Eccleſiaſticall cenſures the Apoſtles and Biſhops were ſupreme, as may be ſeen in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.3. where by the authority of <hi>Paul,</hi> the inceſtuous perſon is to be delivered to Satan. This was the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolike rod, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. and as the Fathers called it, the Biſhops ſword, which no Presbyter did uſe to handle, farther than as it was delega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him by the Apoſtle or Biſhop, to denounce or declare.</p>
                  <p>So 5. In giving definitive ſentence in any matter of faith, we find it ſtill in the Apoſtle or Biſhop, as <hi>Acts</hi> 15.13. after <hi>Peter, Paul</hi> and <hi>Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabas</hi> had been heard, <hi>James</hi> (not the Apoſtle) but Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem,</hi> being preſident of that Councill, gave definitive ſentence in that controverſie, about circumciſing the Gentiles.</p>

                  <p>Yes, in all ages: For from <hi>Adam</hi> to the flood, the diſcipline of the Church was domeſticall and paternall; the moſt ancient of the family being both Prince and Prieſt, by which two Offices God hath alwaies governed his Church. The eldeſt ſon alwaies ſucceeded in his fathers place, except for wickedneſſe he was rejected, as <hi>Cain, Cham,</hi> and <hi>Reuben.</hi> After the flood God continued it in <hi>Shem,</hi> who was King and Prieſt, thought to be <hi>Melchizedeck.</hi> Next God called <hi>Abraham,</hi> whom <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> bleſſed, who ruled his family like a Prince and a Prieſt; ſo did <hi>Iſaack</hi> his ſon, to whom the promiſed ſeed was entailed. His ſon <hi>Jacob</hi> though the younger, got the bleſſing and birth-right. He had twelve ſons, God in them ſevered theſe offices: <hi>Judah</hi> had the ſcepter and ſeed roiall inſured to him; <hi>Levi</hi> had the Prieſthood,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 5.2.</note> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> had the birth-right. And theſe three never met again in any one but in Jeſus Chriſt. Then after <hi>Jacob,</hi> the Church was governed again by the heads and fathers of the twelve tribes, though obſcurely in Egypt, from whence when God had gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly delivered them, and made them his peculiar people, he ſevered the tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> from the reſt, to wait upon his Altar. Yet he made a diſtinction of Prieſts and Levites, and of <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſons from the reſt of the ſame tribe, by committing to them the charge of the holy things of the Tabernacle,<note place="margin">Num. 4. v. 15. 19, 20, 27, 33.</note> and by appointing them over the other Levits
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:37858:125"/>that came of <hi>Gerſhom, Kohah,</hi> and <hi>Merari,</hi> to command them their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ſervices. And God puniſhed thoſe that rebelled againſt this order, as may be ſeen in <hi>Corah, Dathan,</hi> and <hi>Abiram,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 6.9, 10.</note> who accounting that order wherein God had placed them, to be a ſmall matter, did aſpire to the Prieſts office, and ſo incurred upon themſelves the wrath of God. Beſide among the Levites themſelves were three principall heads named by God himſelfe, as <hi>Eliaſaph</hi> for the <hi>Gerſhonites,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 3.24, 30.</note> 
                     <hi>Eliza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan</hi> for the <hi>Kohathites,</hi> and <hi>Zuriel</hi> for the <hi>Merarites.</hi> And afterward there were other chiefe fathers of the Levites, that directed the reſt in their ſeverall courſes allorted by <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.24. The Prieſts alſo were of ſundry orders among themſelves. The firſt dignity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the High Prieſt. The ſecondary to him was <hi>Ithamar,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Num. 4.28, 33.</note> and his off-ſpring, who commanded the <hi>Gerſhonites</hi> and <hi>Merarites</hi> to their ſervice. Theſe were reckoned and called the Princes of the Sanctuary in thoſe things that pertained to God. And out of theſe were cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen by <hi>David,</hi> the twenty four courſes to ſerve in the Temple,<note place="margin">1 Chron. 14.</note> toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with ſubſtitutes under them to aſſiſt in their preſence, or in their abſence:<note place="margin">Luke 1.5. <gap reason="foreign">

                  <p>Though it cannot be proved by conſequent that the Church Chriſtian is bound to the ſame manner of government altogether. For 1.

The politie of the Jewes being contained in the Law of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Deut. 21.19.</note> it was neceſſary the Judges ſhould be aſſiſted by thoſe that had the moſt skill in that Law. 3. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eminence followed the ſame family by inheritance and birth-right, ſo not with us; yet the order that God ſet for ſome to rule over o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, is not lightly to be refuſed, ſince God ſaw it was the beſt order, rather then to leave them to a generall equality of Prieſts; therefore the <hi>Sanhedrim</hi> it ſelfe conſiſted not of all that would come in,<note place="margin">

But it is plain that the Leviticall diſcipline doth ſet a form of divers degrees among Miniſters, by the evident wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God, which may juſtly be imitated by the Chriſtian Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, rather then parity, which God never approved.</p>

<pb n="214" facs="tcp:37858:126"/>would not reign over his Church by his bodily preſence. So he was the diſciples Lord and Maſter even then,<note place="margin">John 13.</note> and all power in heaven and earth was his then, but he did not challenge it til his reſurrection. Then he took the Scepter and Kingdome declaratively, which he only ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſeth by inward and ſpirituall power and grace, but leaves the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall government to others, and keeps the ſpirituall, effectuall, and celeſtiall Kingdome in his own hand, which by his ſpirit in his ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances he conveieth into the hearts of his people; and this Kingdome belongs only to the perſon of Chriſt; and they that think that any man, or corporation of men, whether the Pope or the Presbytery, ſucceeds Chriſt in this Scepter, they be highly deceived: And for the externall government, he left it to the Apoſtles, who had the mind of Chriſt, and they did as I have ſhewed you. They were 1. Greater then others in Chriſts favour, alwaies hearing him. 2. In gifts of the ſpirit far above others,<note place="margin">Acts 2.</note> and in doing miracles. 3.

                  <p>It is true, that upon the two brothers requeſt to be the chief favourites in his Kingdome, which they ſuppoſed would be an earthly dominion, and being rejected, the other diſciples diſdaining them, the Lord tels them that they ſhould not uſe civill juriſdiction over one another, as the Gentiles did; but he doth not deny degrees or diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of adminiſtrations to them; but he thereby inſtructeth them how to uſe the authority given of God,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 10.</note> not for ſubverſion, but edification; ſo that hereby he forbids them compulſive dominion, or violent ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction over their brethren, but to leave that to the ſecular power. Alſo to be ready to humble themſelves to the meaneſt, and of the low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt degree to win them to the Goſpell; but that all miniſters are by that place proved to be equall, I underſtand not, and that becauſe as I have ſaid, they uſed power and authority above others, which they would not have done if Chriſt had forbidden it: yet I conceive the Apoſtles among themſelves were of equall authority, and towards
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:37858:126"/>the brethren they carrried themſelves more like fathers, than Lords or Maſters. Now for their aſſociating other with them. It is true, that many places of Scripture ſeem to make for it <hi>(viz.)</hi> that they had the concurrence of Presbyters, and others called a Presbytery, in their ſeverall diſpenſations, which will not be found ſo, if well exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For firſt, in the choice of <hi>Matthias,</hi>

                  <p>Some gifts were appointed to the Apoſtles perſons. As 1. Their calling by Chriſts own mouth. 2. Their infallibility in truth. 3. The viſible aſſiſtance of Gods ſpirit. 4. To ſpeak <hi>extempore</hi> in divers tongues. 5. To work miracles. 6. To beſtow the gifts of Holy Ghoſt upon others; all which was given to them to beget and convert and confirm Chriſtians at firſt. But this milk is not neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry alwaies to be continued, when the Church is grown to a ripe age; for the Scriptures are afterward ſufficient to make us perfect to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good work,<note place="margin">1 Tim.</note> and the miracles then done are a full confirmation of their truth.

Therefore their ſucceſſors are ſtewards of the myſteries of Chriſt, and are warned to take care of Chriſts flock, <hi>Acts</hi> 20. and of this few doubt; but the power of the keies troubles them to whom they are committed, that is, excommunication and abſolution. So others quarrell about ordination; and theſe are the well-wiſhers to Lay-Elderſhip, which they would have joined in this work with Apoſtles and Biſhops; but they find no warrant for it. I know they bring commonly two or three places of Scripture for Presbyterie; as the hands of the Presbyterie, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. which I have ſhewed were the hands of Biſhops and preaching Elders at leaſt, not of Lay Elders.

                  <p>It is but once mentioned in all the New Teſtament, as in the 1 of <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.14. which I have proved to be only ſpirituall men, as Paſtours and Teachers called Elders; as at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> fifteen years after Chriſts aſcenſion, were Apoſtles and Elders, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. So at
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:37858:129"/>
                     <hi>Antioch</hi> were Prophets and Teachers, as <hi>Barnabas, Simeon, Lucius, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nahen, Saul</hi> and <hi>Mark,</hi> and others, <hi>Acts</hi> 13. which the Apoſtles placed in Cities, where they had planted the Goſpell. This was done for the defence of beleevers againſt ſeducers, that crept into houſes, and ſubverted many, by teaching things that they ought not for filthy lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cres ſake, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And that thoſe ruling Elders were Lay Judges, that <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, it plainly appeareth to the contrary; for the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle there ſpeaks of maintenance allowed out of the Church ſtock, which I never heard or read was given to any Lay ruler; and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly if St <hi>Paul</hi> was loath to have the Church burdened with a wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5.</note> ſo long as her own kindred could maintain her, would leſſe put the charge of a Lay Judge upon it.

Now the Lay Elder is neither of theſe: for they are no Prophets, becauſe they have no charge of his word; nor have they Prieſtly power in regard of ſins, and Sacraments, as <hi>Jam.</hi> 5.14, 15. If any be ſick, let him ſend for the Elders of the Church, who ſhall pray, and annoint him with oile, and his ſins ſhall be forgiven him. Theſe Elders were not Lay men, but ſuch to whom was committed the gift of healing and abſolution. Nor have they the Regall power, for then the Magiſtrate muſt be ſubject to them, not they to him; or if they had, it can laſt no longer than when the Magiſtrate is a Chriſtian: So that I ſee not how Lay Elders ſhould be governors of the Church, but they muſt be Magiſtrates or Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters.</p>

When a Biſhops chair was void, ſome Biſhops that were neereſt conſulted to meet there at a certain day, of which they gave notice to the people and Presbyters of that place, who came on that day into the Church, and three Biſhops at leaſt came alſo from the adjacent places, and there obſerved whom the Clergy named, and whom the people propoſed; and as all or moſt agreed, ſo the man was choſen, but another day fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for his ordination. In the mean time any objections might be made, but if he were clear, the Biſhops made him Paſtor of that Church. But ſecondly, if that City wanted an approved man, then they deſired the Biſhop of the ancienteſt City called the Metropolis, and he the Metropolitan, to ſend them ſuch an one as he approved; which he did after himſelfe and three other Biſhops had tried him.

So that we may ſee that the peoples election was not founded on Gods command, but upon the reaſon of humane government, and was ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the Lawes and Canons of Princes and Prieſts;<note place="margin">Diſt. <hi>61.</hi> S.</note> for the rule was that in the choice of Prieſts, the people was not to be followed but taught, and therefore their power may be forfeited, and transfer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the ſuperiour; and therefore if the multitude have a right, then the Magiſtrate much more.

                  <p>There were at firſt few great Princes Chriſtians, and ſo could have no right in this buſineſſe of electing Biſhops. 2. Biſhops though they had greater authority than Presbyters, yet they had no endowment but from the common charity: and therefore the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple after the Apoſtles time, might juſtly expect ſome hand in the choice of them, and ſo they had. For <hi>Fabianus</hi> the nineteenth Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> was choſen by their full conſent; and ſo they generally had it till after <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Emperour. But we read of <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the elder, commands the Biſhops to give him a catalogue of ſuch whom they thought fit to be made Biſhop of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sozom. <hi>l.</hi> 7.</note> They did, and the Emperour choſe <hi>Nectarius,</hi> one not yet baptized, and hardly known, yet the Councill though he was neither choſen by Clergy nor people, thought it their duty after that he was baptized, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce him Biſhop of <hi>Constantinople.</hi> And this power in Princes aroſe ſometimes from the deſire of the Clergy: as when <hi>Valentinian</hi> willed the Biſhops to elect a Biſhop of <hi>Millane,</hi> to ſucceed <hi>Auxentius;</hi> the Synod praied him, being wiſe and religious, to chuſe one. So ſometimes by reaſon of differences in the choice, it hath been referred to the Emperour: and ſometimes in regard of favour the Emperour had ſhewed to them, in recalling them from baniſhment, building Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Churches for them, and giving them endowments to thoſe Churches, whereby the people were the more eaſed, and the Biſhops more free in the exerciſe of their function. And this was much like the right of patronage which was alwaies allowed, and is ſtill with us here in <hi>England.</hi> But if we ſearch antiquity, we ſhall find Synods allowing this power to Princes <hi>(viz.)</hi> that no man ſhall be ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Biſhop without the King.<note place="margin">

And no wonder if Emperours and Kings looked narrowly to this power, of which as the Pope did ſtrive to rob them on the one ſide, ſo did the Presbytery on the other. Therefore the Statute of Proviſors of benefices,<note place="margin">

                  <p>They followed the Apoſtles rule, namely, to order their ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall congregations by their own ſingular power; but in a matter wherein the whole Church was intereſſed, they governed by Synods and Councils, as the Apoſtles did alſo, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. which Councils they at firſt (before there was a Chriſtian Magiſtrate) called by conſent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, or by the chiefe Biſhop among them.

But had <hi>Charls</hi> the fift dealt as roundly with him about the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> as the Emperour <hi>Sigiſmund</hi> did in the Council of <hi>Baſil,</hi> it had not been twenty five years in calling, nor ſo long in ſitting, and ſo little good done.

                  <p>You think it ſeems that our Biſhops took their ordination there at firſt, or that there were no Biſhops in <hi>England</hi> to ordain o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but they muſt needs travell to <hi>Rome</hi> for it, or take it from <hi>Rome</hi> by delegation; and if ſo, you take our Biſhops and miniſtry to be meerly antichriſtian. But ſuppoſe we had it from thence, that will no more prove our miniſtry antichriſtian or popiſh, then our very Bible, Goſpell, or Baptiſme, if we received it from thence. For ſuperſtition cannot annihilate the ordinances of God, given at firſt from Chriſt, no more then building ſtubble upon the foundation can deſtroy it; or than a ſpring water is utterly ſpoiled by running from a rock through a clay. But our Biſhops and Presbytery, we derive from the Apoſtles, as we do alſo our Proteſtant doctrine profeſſed, which though held in unrighteouſneſſe in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> like a captive for a time, yet at laſt redeemed it ſelfe, and came to light, and ſhewed it ſelfe the true child of God, begotten at firſt in <hi>Rome</hi> by the word of truth, from which ſhee deviating, the truth choſe another foſter-mother to dwell withall, that will maintain her with goods and life, and not forſake
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:37858:133"/>her to the death. So our Biſhops and Clergy came not at firſt from <hi>Rome,</hi> though <hi>Rome</hi> hath made bold to invade the Church of <hi>England.</hi> But for the firſt three hundred years after Chriſt, the Pope had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do out of his own Dioceſſe, as may be ſeen by the Councill of <hi>Epheſus</hi> order,<note place="margin">Con. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> p. <hi>1.</hi> act. <hi>7.</hi>

But the <hi>Brittans</hi> being conquered by the <hi>Saxons,</hi> we find that the <hi>Saxon</hi> Bishops were conſecrated by <hi>Auſtin,</hi> whom <hi>Gregory</hi> the firſt, Bishop of <hi>Rome,</hi> had formerly ſent to bring the Brittans to his three rules.

Now they denying thus to be ſubject to <hi>Rome,</hi> makes others ſuppoſe they had their conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cration from ſome Greek Bishops of the Eaſt, becauſe they ſtood for the celebration of Eaſter with the Greek Church, which yet was a ſchiſme from the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi> who decreed it to be kept contrary to the Eaſtern cuſtome, and agreeable with the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> yet this sheweth that Brittish Bishops had no dependance on the Roman Bishop, no more then they of the Eaſt, who were conſecrated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi>'s authority, according to the Canons of the Councill of <hi>Nice,</hi>

                  <p>They found none, but fained ſome. They pretended that ſet forms of praier were not to be uſed in the Church, neither conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering the authority, antiquity, nor the conveniency of it.

So <hi>Deut.</hi> 26.13. the people are injoined a ſet form of praier after the paiment of his tiths. Nor do they conſider that the book of Pſalms are all ſet forms of praier or praiſe, and delivered to chiefe Muſitians to be ſet to divers inſtruments to praiſe God withall, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 16.7. and 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.3. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.21. and <hi>Ezra.</hi> 3.11. Nor do they diſcern that Chriſt gave his Diſciples a ſet form firſt, gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving it them as a pattern in the firſt year of his miniſtry, <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.9. and in the third year of his miniſtry gives it them as a praier expreſly to be uſed, <hi>Luke</hi> 11.2. when you pray, ſay Our Father: which praier is not of <hi>extempore</hi> conception neither; for we may find in old Jewish Euchologues, moſt of the petitions: not that Chriſt need to borrow of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:37858:135"/>any, but he did it to ſhew that truth was his freehold whereſoever he found it, and to teach us to ſubject our ſelves to the ſpirit in ancient truths, rather then to affect <hi>extempore</hi> raptures. Nor do they perceive the antiquity of ſet forms in the N. T. Church; for we find St <hi>James</hi> the firſt Biſhop of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was the firſt ſetter forth of Liturgies, and he placed there by the Apoſtles. So <hi>Titus</hi> was left in <hi>Creet,</hi> to ſet in order things than were wanting; and what things they were, being they had the Goſpell and Sacraments, let any man tell you, except they were Church Rituals. <hi>Ignatius</hi> alſo, Biſhop of <hi>Antioch,</hi> taught his Church, Liturgies and Doxologies, as appears by the Eccleſiaſticall hiſtories. He lived in the firſt hundred years after Chriſt, and from that Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi>

                     </note> not the Latin Church: but if it did, yet whatſoever is good in it, may be uſed by any Chriſtian Church, except we think it not fit to worſhip Chriſt, becauſe he was ſometimes conſeſſed by the devils mouth. Nor do they ſee the convenience of it; St <hi>Paul</hi> did, namely, that we may with one mind and one mouth, glorifie God the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">Rom. 15.6.</note> And Mr <hi>Calvin</hi> approved it very much, writing to the Protector of <hi>England</hi> in K. <hi>Edw.</hi> the ſixths time, that there ſhould be a form of Church Service, from which Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters might not depart in the exerciſe of their functions, that there may be an help to the ſimplicity of ſome, and a remedy againſt the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of others that affect innovations, and for the clearer appearance of the unanimity of all Churches among themſelves. I know they ſay alſo, that ſet forms of praier hindereth the gift of the ſpirit in mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which would utter it ſelfe freely, but that it is bound up by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding a ſet form. But conſidering that the miniſter is the mouth of the people to God, I conceive it convenient that the people know what he ſollicites God for, that they may the more comfortably join with him in praier. Nor can I ſee how the Church is more edified by <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempore</hi> praier, than a ſet form, ſince the Church is edified as well by Sermons compoſed, as ſermons preached. Beſides, the ſpirit of the Church may edifie her members by her compoſures, as well as any one member may edifie any part of the Church, by his voluntary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions and expreſſions, which may be done for oſtentation, or may want conſideration and diſcretion alſo. Nor doth ſet forms limit the ſpirit any more then <hi>extempore</hi> raptures, neither in the miniſter nor people. Not in the miniſter, for he hath divers times in private devotions, and before and after his Sermon, to enlarge himſelfe far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as occaſion requireth. And for his being ſtinted by the Litur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, there is no reaſon but he may, ſince the ſpirit of the Prophet muſt be ſubject to the Prophets in their prophecying,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 14.</note> and then why not in praying by the ſpirit of the Church repreſentative, which compoſed the Liturgy. And for the ſpirit in the people, it is no more limited by a ſet form, then by a ſudden conceived praier; for their ſpirit be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing equally intent upon this, is as much limited as by that: and ſo as

                  <p>Thoſe ſignificant ceremonies which are mixed with falſe doctrins are unlawfull, as the Phariſees attributed to their waſhing cups, pots, and tables, as great a legall purification of their bodies, as to thoſe waſhings which God had appointed to that purpoſe; yea, they imputed a ſpirituall vertue to them, of cleanſing the ſoule from ſin, which Chriſt reproved, <hi>Mark</hi> 7.8. ſaying, that which is from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out defileth not a man, and therefore that which is a meer outward waſhing, being not of Gods inſtitution, cannot purifie a man; ſo that he condemned not the waſhing, but the falſe opinion joined with it. Beſide, ceremonies are not ſacramentall, but morall ſigns of duty, which are not unlawful, being neither ſignificant by any ſpecial repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, nor obſignant by ratifying to man Gods covenant and grace, but only puts us in mind of ſome duty we owe to God, provided al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies that they be not ſuch ſignificant ceremonies, as God hath taken away by the comming of Chriſt,<note place="margin">Zanch <hi>Epi. ad</hi> Hoop. <hi>p.</hi> 1087.</note> or uſed with any Jewiſh opinion, or popiſh ſuperſtition, as they do their ceremonies. <hi>Abraham</hi> uſed a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony in giving his ſervant an oath, by putting his hand under his thigh, which was a humane ceremony, for <hi>Abraham</hi> had no command from God ſo to do: and it was ſignificant, for it taught a conſidence in Chriſt, who was to come (after the fleſh) out of <hi>Abrahams</hi> loins; for the oath intended that as he hoped to have any happineſſe by Chriſt, who was to come of <hi>Abrahams</hi> ſeed, that he would be faithfull to his maſter, in taking a wife for his ſon. So <hi>Mordecai</hi>'s Feaſt of <hi>Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rim</hi> was a ſignificant ſign to them, to be thankfull for their deliverance from <hi>Human</hi>'s bloody plot. So the yearly Feaſt of Dedication, ſet up by <hi>Machaheus,</hi> 1 <hi>Mach.</hi> 4.59. in remembrance of their deliverance from the cyranny of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> who had forced Idolatry upon them, by ſetting up the image of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the Temple of God, and <hi>Machabeus</hi>

And in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments Church were the Feaſts of charity, both to ſignifie and preſerve love; and theſe were continued till almoſt 500 years after Chriſt.

I beleeve upon this ground it is, that <hi>Luther, Chemnitius</hi> and <hi>Calvin,</hi> allow of pictures in the Church, done by way of hiſtoricall narration, both for ornament and remembrance, without any ſuperſtition. So Holydaies are, and may be celebrated in remembrance of ſome ſpeciall benefit received from God about that time, or by ſome eminent perſon that he hath emploied for the Churches good. And indeed none of theſe things were thought ſuperſtitious, till opinion of merit, and of efficacious operation, was annexed to them. But to conclude, if ceremonies of humane inſtitution being ſignificant to ſome duty which Gods wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship requireth, be unlawfull, I ſee not but men may refuſe to take a lawfull oath, becauſe ones laying their hand on the book and kiſſing it,<note place="margin">Deut. 6.13.</note> ſignifieth a worshipping God the author of that book, in taking the oath, and that one doth aver the truth of his conſcience towards man,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:37858:137"/>as well as his faith towards God in ſo doing. Nor can a man keep the Lords day religiouſly, if it be not a myſtical and ſignificant ſign to him of the reſurrection of Chriſt paſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 4.9.</note> and of our ſpiritual reſt from ſin, &amp; of that eternal reſt which is promiſed to the people of God.

We find alſo, that thoſe things which the Jewes abuſed, was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued by godly men, Biſhops of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in the Primitive times, as Circumciſion though not as a Sacrament, but as a ſign to ſhew they came of the line of <hi>Abraham.</hi> So the Feaſt of Eaſter was kept by many reverend and worthy Biſhops and Martyrs, before the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cill of <hi>Nice,</hi> on the ſame manner and day as did the Jewes, but not with the ſame end as the Jewes did. So the Councill of <hi>Nice</hi> did not aboliſh the feaſt of Eaſter, but changed it into the Lords day. So the Papiſts have abuſed the Lords Supper by erroneous opinions, and idolatrous adorations of it, which ſheweth many good things may be abuſed, and yet are not therefore to be diſuſed: this were to deny the uſe of the Sun, becauſe <hi>Abſalom</hi> lay with his fathers concubins in the open light.

We know the Papiſts have abuſed theſe and others to ſuperſtition: but abuſe makes nothing evill, which is not evill in it ſelfe.

                  <p>Firſt we muſt conſider whether they be offenſive in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or made offenſive by the intention of the Church,<note place="margin">Theo. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 16.</note> as <hi>Julian</hi> the Apoſtate ſet up his image in the Market place, among the images of the heathen gods, that he that gave eivill reſpect to his image, might be thought alſo to do honour to them; or if they did no reſpect, then they might ſeem to deſpiſe both the gods and the Emperour. So he ſet an Altar neer his throne with a fire upon it, and incenſe upon a table,<note place="margin">Sozo. <hi>l.</hi> 3. <hi>c.</hi> 17.</note> and all Officers of his army that came to receive his largeſſe of gold, did firſt caſt ſome incenſe into the fire, by which many were ſcandalized or cauſed to ſtumble. So he cauſed all the fountains in the region of <hi>Antioch,</hi> to be dedicated to the heathen goddeſſes, and all the meat in the Market to be ſprinkled with heatheniſh holy wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; yet the Chriſtians were ſo wiſe, as not to avoid their drink and meat, knowing that to the clean all things are clean, <hi>Tit.</hi> 1.15. and alſo bought what was ſold, and made no ſcruple, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. Then next we muſt conſider, whether the offence ariſes not from our own igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and weakneſſe, and ſo we be not ſtraitned by the Church, but in our own bowels, and ſo like little children that complain their cloaths are to little when their bellies are too full. The offence muſt lie in one of theſe; If it lie in the Agent, it is either directly evill, as <hi>Davids</hi> matter of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.24. which was ſin, or elſe it is indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly, and ſo either with or without the intention of the Agent. 1. Without his intention, as <hi>Peter, Gal.</hi> 2.11. in a partiall complying with the Jewes, had no intent to offend the Gentiles. 2. With his intenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as when men do it of purpoſe to ſtumble others. So Hereticks by ſeeming holy and auſtere, have drawn many from the truth, as did the <hi>Novatians,</hi> who decreed, that men who had fallen by infirmity, ſhould never be received again into the Church: by which ſeeming ſtrictneſſe they got many followers, and continued many years, even from the reign of <hi>Decius,</hi> to the reign of <hi>Julian,</hi> and after. So we ſay men may give offences to the weak, or to the ſtrong: to the ſtrong, as <hi>Peter</hi> was an offence to Chriſt, when he bid him to favor himſelfe;<note place="margin">Mat. 16.</note> for though he ſpake out of good will, yet Chriſt found it a ſubtle temptation, and ſo caſt it as a ſtumbling block out of his way. 2. To the weak (who are not able to diſtinguiſh) we give offence when we do unadviſedly lay things in their way,<note place="margin">Mat. 18.</note> which may annoy them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they be aware. It is true we are not to offend one of Chriſts little ones: But now things indifferent when they be fully determined by the Church of God, we muſt not be contentious, it is not the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of the Church of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16. of which Church we muſt be more tender, then of any particular men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.23. But if indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent things be not at all, or but in part determined by the Church of God, then we muſt conſider charitably of other mens conſciences, who are not fully perſwaded of the lawfull uſe of them: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they are ſo far to be uſed, as they may prove no offence to others, So 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.25. Eat, and make no queſtion or ſcruple, becauſe God hath given us liberty to uſe, or not uſe them; the earth is the Lords to do thee good; but in caſe of offence againſt thy brother, eat not, the earth is the Lords to hurt no mans conſcience by my liberty, or
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:37858:138"/>Gods allowance: ſo that firſt he ſaith eat and make no ſcruple, though the Feaſt was dedicated to Idols, for the earth is the Lords, and mans ſuperſtition cannot abridge thee from the lawfull uſe of the creature. But if a weak brother that is not well ſatisfied in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian liberty, ſhall inform thee of the idolatrous Feaſt, ſaying, this meat is offered to idols, then uſe not thy Chriſtian liberty to the wounding of that weak conſcience; for the earth is the Lords for thee to uſe lawfully, and not licentiouſly. Therefore the Councill of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 15. though they gave liberty to eat meats that were forbidden by <hi>Moſes</hi> law, yet reſtrained the Chriſtians from things ſtrangled, and from blood, and things offered to idols, left they ſhould offend the Jewiſh people newly converted to the Chriſtian faith.<note place="margin">Acts 15.3.</note> So St <hi>Paul</hi> circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> (his father being a Greek) to ſhun giving offence to the Jewiſh converts, yet at another time he would not circumciſe <hi>Titus,</hi>

                  <p>Not ſo; for men may be offended at that which muſt not be avoided; for men may be corrupted (that take offence) in their judgement, or in their affections. 1. In their judgement, as thoſe people were, that took offence at Chriſts doctrine, ſaying, that they muſt eat the fleſh of the Son of man, elſe they had no life in them, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.53. becauſe they underſtood not the ſpirituall ſenſe of it, <hi>ver.</hi> 52. So in their affection; as when by pride men take offence at the ſimplicity of the Goſpell, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.23. Chriſt crucified was to the Jewes a ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling block, and to the Grecians fooliſhneſſe.

                     </note> but where a declaration is, or may be had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the uſing or not uſing ſuch things, there we are not to nouriſh mens preſumptions inſtead of weakneſſe. I know ſome pretend that Papiſts may be the more confirmed in their Religion, to ſee reformed Churches uſe their ceremonies. But I think rather by our reforming what they have abuſed, they may rather ſee the error of their own religion. We may as well refuſe their Churches as their ceremonies, and they may as well be ſetled the more in their religion by our not uſing them (but I fear more by abuſing them.) Indeed ſome mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters have objected againſt the uſe of them, but yet are now reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to them for advantage ſake. So others ſay that our uſe of theſe ceremonies makes profane perſons to contemn all religion; but I think rather that mens ſtripping religion of decent rites, doth more confirm prophaneſſe, then clothing of it with decent ceremonies, and brings in diſparity more then uniformity. So ſome object it is a great hindrance to preachers that cannot conform to them; but the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of preaching the Goſpell ought to overpoize any ceremony, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

                  <p>Though you find little ſpeech of him, as you do of the name of the Father and the Son, yet all thoſe Articles of the Creed
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:37858:139"/>that follow from beleeving in the Holy Ghoſt, do relate to him, and to his operations upon the object thereof, which is the holy Catholick Church, which he ſanctifieth, by making in it the communion of Saints, and ſealing to it the remiſſion of ſin, and beſtowing upon it the power of the bleſſed reſurrection, and the felicity of eternall life. And inſomuch as we are taught to beleeve in the Holy Ghoſt, as well as in the Father and the Son, that word (in) doth intimate to us, 1. That he is God as well as the Father and Son, or elſe we may not beleeve upon him. But we find that we are to be baptized into his name, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the Father and the Son, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.29. 2.

                  <p>I ſhall, firſt he is eternall, and was before the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. and cannot alter his nature and condition. So ſecondly, he is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe, and ſo every where preſent, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.7. and therefore he is at hand alwaies to give us his help and aſſiſtance. Again, he is omnipo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.19. all wonders and miracles were done by him, and therefore he is able to deliver us, and make us for ever moſt happy, as well as he is omniſcient, knowing all our wants, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.19. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.10. Now for his effects they are either common or proper; com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to all creatures, or all men. To all creatures, as in the creation, when the ſpirit of God cowred on the waters and earth mixed toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, not yet ſeparated (as an hen ſitting on egs) thereby qualifying that chaos to take ſeverall forms, <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.2. which ſpirit alſo garniſhed the heavens, <hi>Job</hi> 26.13. and is ſtill ſent forth to continue the creature by production and generation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.30. which kind of operation is common alſo to all men, <hi>Job</hi> 33.4. the ſpirit of the Lord hath made me: and not only ſo, but the ſame ſpirit giveth inventions to men, of Arts and Sciences, as to <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab, Exod.</hi> 31.3. ſo to write excellent things for the common uſe of men; ſo to qualifie Miniſters with the gifts of prophecy and preaching, and tongues, yet not all with ſaving grace, <hi>mat.</hi> 7.22. So many men have illumination to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern of ſome doctrines of faith, by drawing off the vaile that hangs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other mens eies, though without application to themſelves, or correſpondent practice of ſuch knowledge, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. they have a taſte, but no delight nor digeſtion; for it neither takes them from the love of the world, nor makes them the more to love God or good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yea, and in other men he works reſtraining grace to forbear ſome foule ſins, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> to forbear <hi>Sarah, Gen.</hi> 20.6. yea, and to do ſome laudable actions, contrary to their diſpoſition, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.10. when <hi>Saul</hi> prophecied, which was ſo ſtrange to the people, that it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:37858:139"/>a proverb, Is <hi>Saul</hi> alſo among the Prophets. This reſtraining grace God giveth the wicked, not ſur their own, but for the Churches ſake, who would by them otherwiſe in their luſts, be baſely defiled, or utterly deſtroied. Now there be other operations and effects of the ſpirit, proper to the elect, and ſome of them are generall, and ſome particular: the generall are the conception of Chriſt, and the qualification of his humane nature to make it fir for the great work of redemption of the elect, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 61.1. The ſpirit of the Lord is upon me to preach glad tidings, &amp;c. which ſpirit he received without meaſure, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. The ſecond generall work is his dwelling in the elect, by which they are made a temple for God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. and built together for Gods habitation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.22. Alſo regeneration of them, whereby they are waſhed and ſanctified in the name of the Lord Jeſus, and by the ſpirit of our God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. Then next he uniteth the elect into one myſticall body by faith and love in the bond of peace. Beſide,<note place="margin">Eph. 4.3.</note> he hath particular operations in the ſingular perſons of the elect; as firſt he works in them liberty from the power of ſin, and ability to ſubdue the corruption in nature, which neither naturall reaſon, not morall prudence can do, but where the ſpirit of the Lord is, there is liberty, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.13. becauſe the law of the ſpirit of life hath made us free from the law of ſin and death, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. And this the ſpirit doth by exerciſing of us in the works of mortification, till we have crucified the old man, and even wounded ſin to death, by becomming to us the ſpirit of judgement and burning, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 4.4. both to condemn our ſelves, and to conſume our droſſe; therefore it continually luſteth againſt the fleſh, and makes our hearts to riſe againſt ſin,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.</note> as it doth againſt any thing we hate; and if at any time we yeeld to the fleſh, this good ſpirit becomes like a voice behind, calling to us that we are out of the way, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.21. by daily good motions and checks of conſcience, and by baptizing us with fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.11. inflaming our hearts with an holy revenge upon ſin, and with a love to all goodneſſe, righteouſneſſe and truth. Then next he doth infuſe divine graces into the heart, which are like ſo many letters commendatory of us to God; as faith to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve above reaſon naturall, as <hi>Abraham</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.17. and without any viſible means, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.1. ſo alſo he worketh in us love to God, by which we tender the pleaſure of God above all things in doing and ſuffering, of which we are never aſhamed, becauſe the love of God is ſhed abroad in our hearts by this holy ſpirit which he hath given us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and makes us wait by hope, for the righteouſneſſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.5. with longing and ſighing, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. and praying by the ſpirit of ſupplication poured by him upon us, <hi>Zac.</hi> 12.11. and never leaves till he hath made us partakers of the divine nature, reſembling God in ſelfe-contentment, though we be ſhut out of the worlds ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and in being in love with good men that are begotten of God,<note place="margin">1 John 5.1.</note> therefore he is called the ſpirit of love, <hi>Rom.</hi> 15.30. and in wiſedome,<note place="margin">Mar. 13.11.</note> whereby the elect diſcern thoſe myſteries which none knoweth but God and they, for they are not diſcerned by others, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. and alſo in transforming them into the practiſe of thoſe things they hear and beleeve by this ſpirit, from one glorious grace to another, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi>
                     <pb n="242" facs="tcp:37858:140"/>3.18. and this through the ſanctification of obedience, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.2. by which he gives us comfort, by giving us peace of conſcience, and joy in aſſurance of remiſſion and freedome from the guilt of ſin, in which reſpect he is called the comforter, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. and ſo he is, but eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the times of affliction, wherein he gives them ſuch taſtes of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly glory, as makes them to contemn all earthly things, and rejoice in tribulations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.4. becauſe this ſpirit of glory reſteth upon them, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. Thus he goeth alwaies with the elect, working in them a ſpirituall ſtrength to perſevere, though ſometimes they be like ſmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king flax, almoſt choked in their ſad melancholy fumes, or like bruiſed reeds that have no ſtrength, then doth he eſtabliſh the inward man, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.16. by nouriſhing the ſeeds of grace ſown in our drie ground, by his ſweet dew from above, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 44.3. and by his ſecret and powerfull aſſiſtance in the times of triall, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.9. bearing witneſſe to them, that they are the ſons of God for all their croſſes in this world, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.15. which he ſealeth to them by the promiſes beleeved, concerning Chriſt and himſelfe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13. All which conſidered, we ſhould make much of this ſpirit, and not grieve it, nor quench it. Not grieve it by acting without it, by our own ſenſuall deſires, and ſeparating our ſelves from the ſocieties where he doth affoord his gracious diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, <hi>Jud.</hi> 19. or do not acknowledge his power in giving them skill and abilities to perform their ſeverall places and callings; nor asking counſell of him, or direction from him, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 30.1. but rather deſpiſe it even in his ordinances, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.8. and turn their ear from it, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9.20, 30. and harden their hearts againſt it, <hi>Zac.</hi> 7.12. and rebell a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his doctrine, and ſo grieve him in his miniſters, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.10. and <hi>Acts</hi> 7.51. as St <hi>Stephen</hi> told the Jewes, yea, to tempt him by ventu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to try whether he will puniſh them or no, as <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.9. by all which they ſhew, that whatſoever portion of the ſpirit they have received, yet it is in vain.

                  <p>It is a wilfull and totall falling away from the grounds and true beginnings of Chriſt, and from that ſpirituall fellowſhip, which one hath had with the people of God therein, after ones illumination and outward ſanctification, contemning the Goſpell, and deſpighting
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:37858:140"/>the methods and operations of the Holy Ghoſt without repentance, even to death. All this may be gathered from <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5, 6. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.25, 26, 27. But this muſt be rightly underſtood. As firſt, that he muſt be one inlightned with ſome competent knowledge in true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and ſanctified by outward calling, at leaſt to the covenant of grace, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.29. and the ſeals thereof though not ſanctified by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving grace, which ſhewes it ſelfe by true repentance from all ſin, and by relying on Chriſt by faith for his ſalvation. So next he muſt wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apoſtate, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.26. as it were without temptation, not as <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> by luſt, or <hi>Peter</hi> by feare, yea, it muſt be a totall falling from all parts of truth, which may poſſibly over-power his nature, by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of the law. Alſo he muſt deſpiſe the Goſpell, and even loath the way of ſalvation by Chriſt, and ſcorne, the Goſpel, which is the meanes of ſanctification, and hath in ſome manner worked formerly upon himſelfe ſome change of mind and manners.

                  <p>Firſt let him examine himſelfe whether he have the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.9. and we may know it by its luſting againſt the fleſh, and making our heart to riſe againſt ſin, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. Next it begets in us a pleaſant taſte of things that are of a ſpirituall nature; for of our ſelves we have ſpirituall foul palates, like people in feavers,<note place="margin">Rom. 8.5.</note> that makes them diſtaſte what is good. Next it ſtirs us up to mortifie ſin and all evill concupiſcence, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13. and then it gives us victory over ſin, by making us free from the law of ſin, by the law of the ſpirit of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.2. ſo that the body is dead becauſe of ſin, but the ſpirit is life becauſe of righteouſneſſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.10. by which the heart is circumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, as well as the outward man or the outward manners, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.29. Beſide, this ſpirit doth transform us into the image of holineſſe from
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:37858:141"/>one glorious grace to another, as he hears them related in Gods word, wherein we behold the glory of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. alſo it makes us glorifie God in the very fires of affliction, becauſe his love is ſhed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. and when a man findeth that he hath the Holy Ghoſt, then let him beware of thoſe ſins that are forerunners of this. As firſt, the forſaking of that means by which they were once enlightned, as the Jewes did the miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, who was a burning and a ſhining light, and for a while they rejoiced in his light, but after fell away. So take heed of affecting mens praiſes more then Gods, and of a common alienation of the mind from goodneſſe, and of evill actions without temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of envy at godly men, and miſinterpretations of their good words and works. If they have any ſenſe of theſe ſins, break off the courſe of them, leſt you proceed to the contempt of the operation of this good ſpirit, but rather behave themſelves as thoſe that partake of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.25. by bringing forth the fruits of the ſpirit, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.22. as love, joy, peace, long ſuffering, gentleneſſe, goodneſſe, faith, meekneſſe, temperance, &amp;c. by which they are known to be his Church.</p>

                  <p>This word Church is to be conſidered nominally, locally, and perſonally. The word or name <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> the Church, was uſed among the Athenians for an aſſembly of Citizens called together out of the common multitude by name, by a publick Crier to hear the decrees of the Senate; which word is uſed by the Apoſtle, to ſignifie the Church Chriſtian, which alſo ſignifieth a company of people called together by the voice of Gods miniſters, out of the rude world, and kingdome of Satan to hear the Goſpell revealed from Heaven. But the word Church is derived of the Greek word that ſignifieth Lord; from which word <hi>Kyriake</hi> or <hi>Kyrios,</hi> Lord, comes the Scotch word <hi>Kirk,</hi> and our word Church.</p>

They may as well be afraid to pray in any Pariſh called by a ſuperſtitious name, as in the Church ſo called, if they neglect the doctrin of faith, which directs us to the true uſe of every creature.</p>

                  <p>Not any one man, as the Papiſts make the Pope to be the Church virtuall, nor a company of any creatures, ſave men; for bruits are uncapable of rationall doctrine, nor are Angels tied to it; for Chriſt is not their nature, but the ſeed of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> But the Church perſonall is a company of people every where diſperſed, ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually called ordinarily by the miniſters of the word, from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneſſe of the world, to the ſupernaturall dignity of Gods children, to whom they are united in Chriſt by faith, and to one another by love. In which people we are to conſider their inviſible eſſence, and their viſible exiſtence. Firſt, their viſible exiſtence which they have in common with the viſible Church, being admitted into it by that way that God in his word hath appointed for that purpoſe, as the Jewes were by circumciſion under the law, and both the profeſſors of Chriſt among Jewes and Gentiles by baptiſme under the Goſpell. Secondly, they are to be conſidered in their inviſible eſſence, which is faith in God through Chriſt, and love to one another. This Church is inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the viſible Church, though not ſo plainly diſcerned as the viſible is, yet they partake of the ſame bleſſings and afflictions with the Church viſible, as a child in the womb of the mother partaketh of her joies and griefs.</p>

                  <p>The viſible is that univerſall and Catholike Church, which God hath endowed with the means of ſalvation through Chriſt, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped or preached: as he was typed and prophecied of, the Jewes were a chiefe part of it, as they were a ſetled Church; but before that it remained in the family of <hi>Adam,</hi> and <hi>Sheth,</hi> and <hi>Noah,</hi> whoſe Ark was a type of the Church. Then after the flood in a few families, eſpecially in thoſe that came of <hi>Shem,</hi> from whom came <hi>Abraham</hi> in the ninth generation after him, being the ſon of <hi>Terah,</hi> whom God called from <hi>

                  <p>In beleeving that God would raiſe up one out of his ſeed, in whom mankind ſhould be bleſſed, even Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe ſufferings were ſignified by ſacrifice, without which analogicall relation, they could never have ſavoured ſweetly with God. And as beleeved on Chriſt to come, ſo Chriſtians beleeve on the ſame Chriſt paſſed. And this beliefe is the eſſentiall being of a true Chriſtian, that is, a tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting upon Chriſt by faith, for perfect redemption. And this is that makes the difference between the viſible and inviſible Chriſtian; for the viſible or externall Chriſtian, is one that partaketh of the viſible priviledges of the Church, as Word and Sacraments, but not of the inviſible graces thereof: they hear and underſtand not: they receive, but perceive not: they read, but beleeve not: they beleeve literally not ſpiritually: they conceive, but do not produce Chriſt but abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively. But the other Chriſtian is not only viſible by profeſſion and participation of the common rites of the Church, but is alſo a parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker of the inviſible graces offered and conveied under thoſe outward myſteries of the Church, by the grace of faith, which only juſtifieth him to Godward,<note place="margin">Jam.</note> and produceth good works, whereby he is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his faith with man, and approved a true viſible Chriſtian.

                     <hi>What be the marks of an inviſible Chriſtian, by which he may know himſelfe to be of the true inviſible Church? and then I ſhall deſire ſome ſatisfaction in the outward government of the Church.</hi>

                  <p>The marks of an inviſible Chriſtian by which he knoweth himſelfe to belong to ſalvation in Chriſt, are vocation, adoption, rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, juſtification and ſanctification, and a certain hope of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall glory built upon his beleefe in Chriſt, which is the ground of his hope. Now vocation is not that by which God cals men in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, by the Word and Sacraments, but a divine vertue wrought in our hearts thereby, through the Holy Ghoſt, by which we are moved from our corrupt and ſinful condition, to a ſupernaturall life in Chriſt, to whom being united as to our head, are juſtified by faith, ſanctified by repentance to Gods glory, and a mans owne ſalvation. This is an act of Gods free good wil to his elect, &amp; therfore is both efficacious &amp; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.29. and therefore this grace of calling is not uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, but belongeth only to thoſe whom God foreknew and elected, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. and whom Chriſt hath redeemed, only we may know that we are called, if our hearts be ſtirred up to praiſe God for it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.9. and pray to be eſtabliſhed in it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.10. and to live a godly life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.1. aiming at eternall glory, that we may be found blameleſſe, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.23.</p>
                  <p>The next mark is adoption, a moſt gracious benefit of God where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he receives us that are ſtrangers from him, for Chriſts ſake to be his
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:37858:145" rendition="simple:additions"/>children, and makes us with him to become heirs of heaven and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.5. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.21. by which we are incouraged to call God Father,<note place="margin">Chryſ <hi>hom. in</hi> Pſal. 150.</note> 
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. and confeſſe that we have received, and hope to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all graces and favours from him. This grace is begun in this life, in thoſe who receive Chriſt by faith, <hi>John</hi> 1.12. in whom it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth they are ſons, but yet it appeareth not what they ſhall be, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> but that ſhall be perfected at the reſurrection, for which perfect adoption, we ſigh longing for the redemption of our bodies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.23. Now we know that we are adopted by the liberty which God hath given us, not only from the ſervitude and bondage of the law, which exacts that of us which we cannot do, and from the ſervice under the dominion of ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. and from humane traditions, and worldly rudiments, <hi>Col.</hi> 2. but alſo from that human fear of ſerving God; ſo that we can ſerve him with a free and ready mind, as <hi>Luke</hi> 1.74. he ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving delivered us, and ſo we delight in the law of God after the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man, and can come boldly to the throne of grace, to make our wants known to God our Father.</p>
                  <p>The next note is regeneration, a bleſſed benefit of God, whereby he reſtoreth our corrupt nature to his own image by the Holy Ghoſt, and the incorruptible ſeed of his Word, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.23. This is the effect of a moſt bleſſed marriage, where God is the Father, mans eare is the wife, the ſeed is the word, the heart is the womb, and the regenerate ſoule is the child, which is bred with ſighing, and brought forth with ſorrowes, but great joy at the delivery. But as it groweth, it is like <hi>Jacob</hi> in great conflict with <hi>Eſau,</hi> namely, the fleſh, as you ſee <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. both dwell in one houſe, but <hi>Jacob</hi> the ſpirit alwaies gets the upper hand, both in the bleſſing and in the birthright, yet with great relucta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this, till we are freed by death, and the fleſh glorified at the reſurrection. The effects of this regeneration is, 1. A love to God that begot us above all things, and love to them that are begotten as we are, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2. Avoiding of ſin, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. he that is born of God ſinneth not, but keepeth himſelfe, namely, he ſinneth not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly, wilfully, delightfully, deſpitefully againſt the rule of grace, not continually, not to death, and by vertue of Chriſts reſurrection, leadeth a new life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4. and 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.3. and therefore through Chriſt, God ſeeth no ſin in him to condemn him, however he doth to correct him;<note place="margin">Rom. 8.</note> for it is Chriſt that juſtifieth, who can condemn.</p>
                  <p>The next note whereby one may know himſelfe to be of the Church inviſible, is juſtification, which ſignifieth as much as to make juſt, as to purifie is to make pure. The word is not found in any of the old and pureſt Latine authors, but is taken up by divers to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe the Hebrew and Greek terms,<note place="margin">Tſadhick. <gap reason="foreign">

                        </gap>.</note> of a juſt man. Now a man is ſaid to be made juſt by infuſion, or by plea. By infuſion, when the habit or quality of juſtice is put into one, as into <hi>Adam</hi> by creation, and ſo men by regeneration in ſome degree; and thus one may be ſaid to be formerly or inherently juſt; yet to juſtifie ſignifieth ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what elſe. 2. A man may be juſtified by plea; as he that accuſeth one makes him unjuſt,<note place="margin">Eſa. 5.23.</note> ſo he that by plea doth vindicate him, hath made him an honeſt man,<note place="margin">Job 9.20.</note> that is, to be eſteemed or reputed ſo, as the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient

                        </gap>.</note> So that in this caſe we are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to lean to the common uſe of the word, then to the ſound ariſing from the notation; for <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.4, 8. the law is called by the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preter, juſtifications, not becauſe they juſtifie a man, but becauſe they declare him juſt that doth them, becauſe he hath done according to thoſe ſtatutes. So a Judge condemning a malefactor, is not by that act made formally, or inherently juſt, but approved juſt by that law which he hath executed. But this declaration of a mans juſtice, is not juſtification, for that takes place upon accuſation only: if <hi>Adam</hi> had not ſinned, he might have been commended and declared to be juſt and innocent, yet not properly juſtified. So wiſedome is ſaid to be juſtified by her children,<note place="margin">Mat. 11.19.</note> 
                     <hi>i.</hi> vindicated to be juſt againſt all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils of wicked men, by the apology that her children make in her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. Some men therefore are juſtified, yet not inherently juſt; as when a fault is charged and acknowledged, and ſatisfaction pleaded, or ſufficient amends is made to the party offended, and ſo freedome from puniſhment is merited, and the fault therefore as it were extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed, becauſe the party offended reapeth as much benefit, as if the fault had never been committed: but if the offended ſhall accept on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of a bare acknowledgement of a fault, or a promiſe of amends, that cannot be pleaded for ſatisfaction to juſtifie; or if the fault be of ſo high a nature, that no ſufficient amends can be made, there is no means for the offender to be juſtified; otherwiſe if the party offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded have made full ſatisfaction, then is he free from puniſhment, and to be reputed blameleſſe. Now this ſatisfaction is made by doing or ſuffering, that which (ſaving the fault) is not due. And this may be done by the offender himſelfe, or by another for him: The offender himſelfe may plead ſatisfaction, if he can prove that the plaintiff hath committed as great a fault againſt himſelfe. But ſatisfaction made by another, is when the doing or ſuffering by another, is accepted for the doing or ſuffering of the offender himſelfe: and this may ſatisfie for the offender, better then he can ſatisfie for himſelfe oftentimes. So a man cannot ſatisfie God for his offence by any act of his own, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his beſt righteouſneſſe is imperfect and ſinfull; but being ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified by anothers ſatisfaction, he is made juſt by the juſtice of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that is, by the imputation of the others merit, though that merit be not reputed as done by the offender, but accepted for him, no more then the offenders ſin can be reputed his that juſtified him, though it may be imputed to him. Now the effect of juſtification is pardon, which is the remitting of puniſhment deſerved by an offence, yet it is not any eſſentiall part of juſtification, but only a conſequent or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent effect thereof. Now juſtification is before God or man, that before man you may apprehend by what hath been ſaid; that before God is thus to be conſidered. God is infinitely juſt, ſinne is a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of his infinite will and wiſdome, which is the rule of juſtice; the puniſhment due to this ſin, is everlaſting torments in hell; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be juſtified before God, is to be cleered in his ſight from the guilt of ſin, and to be abſolved from that puniſhment, which in divine juſtice is due to ſin: and this none can avoid, unleſſe he can plead the
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:37858:146"/>fulfilling of the law, or that which is proportionable thereto; we cannot plead the fulfilling of the Law, for the moſt righteous man doth tranſgreſſe it.<note place="margin">

No man can do that if he offend but one tittle of the law, nor free himſelfe from everlaſting puniſhment: nor can he plead that he hath ſuffered any injury at Gods hand, whereby he can claim acquittance from the leaſt ſin: nor can any other meer crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture make ſatisfaction for him, that creature being ſinite, and Gods wrath infinite: therefore he that juſtifieth man, muſt not only be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly righteous himſelfe, but infinite alſo, and Almighty, and ſo no leſſe then God, <hi>Eſa.</hi> 63.1, 2, 3. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.2, 6.

Now it would have puzled Angels and men to find out ſuch an one, God only hath revealed him in the Goſpell, namely, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt the only begotten ſon of God, the ſecond perſon in the moſt glorious Trinity, 1 <hi>John</hi> 14.18. <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.24. by whom we are juſtified by his ſatisfaction, and are made righteous before God, by that righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe which is formally in Chriſt alone, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8, 9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.21.

                  <p>Another mark of a true Chriſtian inviſible, is ſanctification, not of office as conſecration, but an holy quality of mind, and diſpoſition and renovation of ſpirit, by which we put off the old converſation, and put on the new man, which after God is created in righteouſneſſe and true holineſſe. And by this means we come to walk worthy of our calling to holineſſe,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 1.9.</note> which muſt be now as our profeſſions are in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, wherein every one deſireth to excel by making his calling his buſineſs, and to ſhew himſelf a work man that needeth not be aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med. This the Apoſtle cals glorification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. becauſe indeed grace is but glory initiated, and glory is but grace conſummated. This is done when God is pleaſed to magnifie the power of his word in our hearts, to ſanctifie ſo throughly, that our ſpirits, ſoules and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, may be blameleſſe. Of this many boaſt of it, and the Papiſts nouzle them in it, by ſaying, that ſanctification is incident to repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates; and that caſtawaies may partake of the renewing of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. But ſurely they may ſay as well, that they are united to Chriſt, how elſe can they partake of his ſpirit? or can they be ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied that have not his ſpirit? or have they his ſpirit that are not his members? Indeed there be ſome things that beare a reſemblance with it, in which the world is received: and that is, 1. Civility or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon honeſty; and the next is reſtraining grace, by which they may be ſaid to be ſanctified ſacramentally, or putatively,<note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.</note> or diſpoſed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6.4, 5. but this is but to have it <hi>fieri,</hi> but <hi>non in facto eſse, i.</hi> in a way toward it, but not in throughly or truly: and therefore men muſt diſtinguiſh between civility which is wrought meerly by morall education, according to naturall principles, without any knowledge or deſire of knowing Gods word, but they are carefull to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain equity and common honeſty for the keeping up of trade, and commendation of themſelves: upon which ground alſo they keep themſelves from drunkenneſſe, whoredome, and enormous crimes, without relation to Gods word. Now ſanctification though it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to the ſame things or duties, yet it doth it by the true medium of heavenly light, which is the word of God; and they that do not ſo, are as far from ſanctification, as the heathen moralliſts. Now their civility, and all meer naturall mens honeſty, ſtands principally in the duties of the ſecond table, where the light of nature is moſt clear; but for matters of piety in the firſt table, they obſerve it but ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſo far as they conduce to preſerve their credit among thoſe they live withall: but true ſanctification hath an eie to both, to give to <hi>Caeſar</hi> and to God their ſeverall duties.<note place="margin">Mat. 22.21.</note> So the morall holy man reſts only in negatives, and thinks it charity enough not to do hurt, but true holineſſe doth both eſchew evill, and do good, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.11. So the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man thinks it holineſſe enough to profeſſe a diſlike of popery, and to quarrell with a Biſhops dignity, though they be utterly ignorant of the orthodox faith, and the grounds of the true worſhip of God. Again, civility never goeth beyond the outward man,<note place="margin">Mat.</note> becauſe it takes hold only of the outward letter of the law, but paſſeth over the ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall ſenſe of it. So he that hath reſtraining grace which he takes for ſanctification, is much deceived; for the difference between them is,
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:37858:147"/>that reſtraining grace hath painfulneſſe and diſcontentment, at the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle that God puts upon them, and at the bands wherewith they are bound, at which they rage, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.1, 3. as horſes that ſome upon the bit by which they are guided, whereas a man that is truly ſanctified, deſireth that his very inclinations to evill, were utterly aboliſhed, that it might not rebell againſt the law of the mind.<note place="margin">Rom. 7.23.</note> Again, they deſire to extend their Chriſtian liberty to the utmoſt, without enquiring after the bounds of liberty, or the expedience of putting it in practice; but a man ſanctified deſireth to ſubſiſt within his bounds, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.12. and had rather live where nothing is lawfull, then where all things are lawful. Beſide, there is great difference in their abſteining from ſin; for reſtraining grace makes one abſtaine from ſin for fear or ſhame, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they would give the greater liberty to ſome ſin which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to nouriſh,<note place="margin">

Again, they that have only reſtraining grace, when the means of that ſtraint is removed, grow licentious, as Iſrael, when they had no King, <hi>Judg.</hi> 17.6. and the 18.19. but they that are ſanctified are a law to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.9. they need none of the terrors of it, though they are willing to be led by the doctrine of it. By theſe rules thou maiſt know whether thou art ſanctified or not, and from theſe marks ariſe an aſſured hope of eternall glory, becauſe we carry about us the ground of things hoped for, and the evidence of things not ſeen, of which at the firſt it may be we have but a conjecture, <hi>i.</hi> a light in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to the probability of Goſpell truths; next an opinion, wherein the mind is more ſtrongly ſwaied to think it true.

Now in this caſe ſome have a little faith, ſome a full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of it, which is peculiar to Gods people; and they may know they have it by the comfort that it affords to one under the preſſures of ſin and Gods juſtice, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 73.23, 24. and alſo by the raviſhing of the affections to the love of thoſe truths, which is very ſtrange and ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naturall; for there is no greater antipathy in the world, then there is between mans heart and Gods word, and yet by faith is bred ſuch af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to it, that a man will give his life, rather then one tittle of this truth ſhould faile: and beſide, it worketh a ſtrange change in the whole man from ſin to righteouſneſſe, that one can hardly know him to be the ſame man:<note place="margin">

Two things muſt eſpecially be obſerved in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. 1. That it be not put off and deferred. 2.

Nor need we think confeſſion is abſolutely neceſſary to ſalvation; for <hi>Peter</hi> wept, but ſaid nothing as we read of, yet ſanctification produceth a confeſſion of ſin firſt to God, either publickly, as <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. or privately, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5. and that generally of all ſin, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.13. or parricularly,

There is another confeſſion which is made before the Paſtors of the Church, of ſome ſins which burden conſcience, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. So there is a publick confeſſion of ſins made by Prieſt and people to God, in the publick place and exerciſe of religion, either ordinarily of the common ſins that cleave to nature, or extraordinarily on the times of humiliation for ſome peculiar ſins that have infected both Prieſt and people, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1.7. So there is a confeſſion which hath been uſed in the Church, by thoſe which for diſobedience have been excommu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated, and could not be received into the congregation again with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch confeſſion. But theſe confeſſions prove not papiſticall, au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricular confeſſion of all ſin to be either forced upon men as lawfull or neceſſary to our reconcilement with God: for as it is impoſſible to confeſſe all ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 19.13. ſo it is not any where commanded in Scripture, nor any example given that it ſhould be ſo done to a Prieſt, or to that end; and the rather becauſe there is another rule of remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and juſtification with God, ſet down, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.21. and <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.23. namely, repentance and faith. Indeed confeſſion of ſin was not eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed as the Papiſts urge it, till the time of Pope <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, who did order in the Councill of <hi>Lateran</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> about the year 1215. that all of either Sex, after they came to the years of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion, ſhould confeſſe all their ſins faithfully once in a year to their own Prieſt, which was ſeconded by the Councill of <hi>Trent,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joined confeſſion before Eaſter, but we find it not impoſed by any di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, as it is of no great antiquity. Therefore though a man may in caſe of a troubled conſcience, go and confeſſe to one that is a true miniſter and lawfully called thereunto, having the word of reconciliation, and Goſpell diſpenſation committed to him, yet he is not to be forced thereunto; for in that there is too much formality, and ſomething of tyranny: or if thou haſt wronged thy neighbour, thou maiſt confeſſe thy fault to him; but if thou beeſt aſhamed to confeſſe it,<note place="margin">Chryl. <hi>hom.</hi> 2. <hi>in</hi> Pſal. 50.</note> leſt it prove approbrious to thee, yet confeſſe it daily to God and thine own ſoule, and deviſe ſome means or way to make him ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>conf. cap.</hi> 3. Amb. <hi>lib.</hi> 10. <hi>in</hi> Luke cap. 96</note> as the caſe requireth; for ſome ſins (as <hi>Peters</hi>) are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by the eie in tears, when ſhame ſtops the mouth of confeſſion, and let thoſe exactors paſſe that are very curious in the ſearch of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mens ſins, but too ſloathfull to amend their own. Now the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of repentance, is a chriſtian holy life, by which we come to be of the communion of Saints. And ſuch a life we muſt lead, that we may recover that chiefe part of Gods image loſt, conſiſting in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and holineſſe. And this is neceſſary becauſe our God is holy, and we are joined to this holy God, and made his people by covenant, and he hath in Chriſt purged us, redeemed us, and adopted us his children; and becauſe Chriſt hath inſerted us into his own body, as his mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and the Holy Ghoſt hath dedicated us as temples to God, and hath appointed us to heavenly incorruptibility; and therefore a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian life conſiſteth not in an outward profeſſion of the Goſpell in
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:37858:148"/>tongue, but in an imitation of Chriſt, having his word for the rule, and Gods glory for our end and ſcope, ſimplicity and ſincerity for the mode and manner of it, with a continuall perſeverance, and daily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſe in it. Now of this life there be three parts. 1. A deniall of our ſelves. 2. A meditation of life to come. 3. A right uſe of worldly goods.</p>

Firſt, to men, ſo that is honor we prefer before our ſelves thoſe whom we ought, and as much as we ought, and ſo by humility, candor and modeſty, we deſtroy pride and hypocriſie. So we muſt be ready to benefit all men out of the ſincere affection of charity, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.1, 2. becauſe the end why God gives his benefits, is, that they may be beſtowed for the common good of the Church, as God beſtoweth his providence in common among good and bad, and we know not fully who are good, and who may not be made good by our charity, they all bearing out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly to us the ſame image of God, and the ſimilitude of Chriſts members.</p>
                  <p>Now ſecondly, the deniall of our ſelves in relation to God, ſtandeth in theſe two things. Firſt in an equanimity, and a fair conſtruction of mind in all actions and ſtate of life. Secondly, in bearing the croſſe aright. The firſt of theſe appears in our being ſubject to Gods will in all things, and in ſhunning ambition and covetouſneſſe, and expect proſperity only from God, depending only upon him, and not deſire riches or honours without him, or out of him, and therefore to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low no wicked arts to compaſſe them, but to caſt all the burden and care of them only upon him, and ſo not envy any mans proſperity, but commit all accidents of life to Gods will, as afflictions, diſeaſes, and poverty, and the death of friends, and to bear all with patience. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the deniall of our ſelves in relation to God, ſtands in the right carriage of the croſs, and a moderate bearing of that adverſity which God ſends upon us, by what hand ſoever it be outwardly afflicted, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.4. and ſo obtain the bleſſing of the mourners comfort, which cauſeth us though troubled, yet not diſtreſſed, though perplexed, yet not in deſpaire, perſecuted, yet not forſaken, caſt down, but not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroied, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.8, 9. This is done, firſt, by conſidering how the glory of God is illuſtrated by freeing his people from it, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.17, 18. and how we are taught to hate both ſin, the devill, the world, and the fleſh, <hi>John</hi> 15.19. and to ſerve God not for worldly pleaſure and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but for his own ſake, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.5. And ſecondly, it is done by conſidering the comforts of the croſſe, which are, Firſt, that God hath purpoſed and appointed all the ſufferings of the Church, and neither
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:37858:149"/>men nor devils can add to them one jot more then he hath determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, <hi>John</hi> 19.11. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.28. And ſecondly, that our ſins are forgiven us in Chriſt, with whom, and for whom we ſuffer, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.12. if we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer for a good conſcience, which makes the event of the croſſe happy, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.13, 14. and gives us hope of an eternall reward by the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9. and of the Saints, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.2. who by faith and patience obtained a good report, becauſe they ſuffered for righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.10.</p>
                  <p>The next buſineſſe of a Chriſtian life, is to meditate on the life to come, as thoſe that behold things promiſed afar off, and ſeek another country beſide and above this world, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.13, 14. This meditation includeth a contempt of the world, as of riches, honours, pleaſure, and of death, which like phyſick doth evacuate many evill humours, by conſidering the various afflictions of this life, and that all the joy and pleaſures of it are but momentany, and yet hinder us from imploying the mind about heaven, though themſelves have in them neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance nor contentment, they neither ſatisfie nor ſanctifie us, but are like painted reeds, gay vanities without, but hollow within, though we run after them as children, after butter flies, and get a fall by follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome hurt by heedleſſe purſuing them. And this contempt of the world would be the more ſeriouſly performed, if we conſider that here we are exiles from home, <hi>i.</hi> from heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9. and therefore we ſhould have a moſt ſerious and joifull deſire of the life to come, which would make us either value death as nothing, or elſe look upon it as Chriſt hath made it, namely an entrance into life, and a freeing us from our ſtep-mother the world, by delivering us to the heavenly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which is the mother of us all. Indeed if we do not thus, the common creature ſhames us, who ſigh and grone to be delivered, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.19. And the heathen wiſe men, and Philoſophers, thought it their glory to contemn death: yet I do not ſay that this life, or the things thereof are altogether to be deteſted, for they are the bleſſings of God, and teſtimonies of his good will to help through this wilderneſſe of ſin; but ſo far to contemn them, as they make us obnoxius to ſin.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the third part of a Chriſtian life, is to make a right uſe of thoſe that God hath afforded us in this life. In this caſe we muſt mark the right uſe and abuſe of thoſe things. The right uſe, is to make them ſerve our neceſſity, not ſuperfluity, and to increaſe our delight in, and praiſe to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 104.1, 15. and ſo taſting, thou maiſt ſee how good the Lord is. The abuſe, when firſt, we exceed our meaſure, and incline to extreams: God makes our cup overflow, and we make it overflow us. Or ſecondly, when we are too abſtemious in denying to our ſelves the lawfull uſe of the creatures, which God hath given us to lead us to acknowledge the bounty of the Creator. The one way we make our belly our God, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.19. The other are too ſuperſtitious, as were the Eſſens, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.21. the one through too much love of the creature, doth extinguiſh the meditation of the life to come, and the other doth fruſtrate the favor of God offered to him in this life; of both which faults we muſt give an account, eſpecially
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:37858:149"/>we being of the true Catholick Church, which teacheth the right uſe of theſe things, and are well underſtood by thoſe that are of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion of Saints.</p>

                  <p>By the Catholick Church, I mean that which is intended in the Creed, which I beleeve to be, though I beleeve not in it, as I do in the holy Trinity, yet that it is, and ever will be while the world endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth, notwithſtanding all the power of Satan, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.10. And of this Church we are to beleeve that we are members, and profeſſe our ſelves to be joined thereunto, and to live and die members thereof. Now this Catholike Church is the City of the living God, or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of holy men, who by the free election of God, are called to union with Chriſt, God and man, to life eternall, as well thoſe ſoules that are triumphant in heaven, as thoſe people that are militant here on earth, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.18. of all which Chriſt is the head; for I reckon not Angels to be of the Church, but only thoſe for whom Chriſt died, that he might ſanctifie them, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.16. but as he took not the nature of Angels, ſo he died not for them. Not for the good, for they needed no ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication by redemption, though a preſervation in their ſtanding, by the vertue of him, in whom they were firſt called to immutability of eſtate, who was the firſt born of every creature, becauſe he was eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally born of God, before any creature was made, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.15. and by him they were made, and therefore muſt hold their eſtates; but yet they cannot be of the redeemed Church, in regard they were never captived, nor did ever fall from, nor fall out with God, and ſo need him that was only a Mediator between God and man, of whom this Church conſiſteth, which is one, holy, Catholike Church, built on the foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets, Chriſt being the head corner ſtone. This is the ſubject of all the benefits which God hath afforded us in Chriſt through his ſpirit; and is called one, becauſe it is the one only myſticall body of Chriſt, and hath but one faith to knit it to Chriſt, and one ſpirit to agitate it, one God by whom it is called to worſhip him, and to be glorified of him; one love by which all the members are gathered among themſelves, and one ſalvation the felici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty thereof, and one bond of divine love in Chriſt toward her, in which reſpect ſhe is called his friend, his beloved, and his Spouſe. So it is called Catholike in regard of the univerſall largneſſe of it, being tied to neither perſons, time, nor place. Therefore it is either ignorantly or arrogantly aſſumed by the Papiſts, who call their Roman Church, Catholike, whereas it wants the Catholike extenſion of it, as well as the Catholike truths of it. So it is called holy, becauſe it hath a moſt holy and ſanctifying head, by which ſin is not imputed, and her cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions by the Holy Ghoſt by degrees taken away, that ſhe may be preſented to God without ſpot or wrinkle, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.27. So it is called Propheticall and Apoſtolicall, becauſe ſhe is founded upon their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                  <pb n="262" facs="tcp:37858:150"/>
                  <p>Now the parts of this Church are triumphant or militant: The triumphant is that part which now triumpheth with Chriſt the head of the Church, over all enemies, and enjoieth with him all gladneſſe and felicity of ſoule, and after the reſurrection ſhall enjoy the fulneſs of it in ſoule and body united. That the ſoules of the juſt after death do enjoy heavenly felicity, is plaine, becauſe it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.15. that the ſoules of the dead were before Gods throne, in white robes ſerving God day and night; and becauſe Chriſt promiſed the theefe that time he died, that his ſoule ſhould be with him in Paradiſe, <hi>Luke</hi> 23.43. which Paradiſe St <hi>Paul</hi> calleth the third heavens, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2, 4. And it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.23. that the ſpirits of juſt men are in the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and therefore when this tabernacle is diſſolved, <hi>i.</hi> our bodies, we have an houſe in heaven, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.1. or elſe St <hi>Paul</hi> had lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle reaſon to deſire diſſolution, if not to be with Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. But yet all this proveth nothing for the Popes canonization of Saints, whoſe memoriall is eſteemed of all good men, and their examples imitated: but we find no Scripture for their canonization, nor for thoſe honors the Pope gives them. As 1. To be written in a Cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logue, thereby commanding them to be called Saints. 2. By calling on them in the praiers of the Church. 3. By dedicating to their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory Temples and Altars. 4. By offering any ſacrifice in their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor. And 5. Celebrating daies feſtivall to their memory. 6. By ſetting up their pictures. 7. By reſerving their reliques to worſhip. And all this muſt be done by the Pope and none elſe,<note place="margin">

But theſe images, and worſhipping of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques, might the more eaſily be obtruded upon the people, after that Libraries were deſtroied by the invaſion of the Goths and Vandals, by which means ignorance and negligence crept into the Church. Much leſſe is the ſigne of the Croſſe then to be worſhipped, as a thing that either ſanctifieth, or puts the devill to flight, as the Papiſts ſay, for that belongs to the efficacy and merit of Chriſts death; nor have we any command or example in Scripture for ſo doing. It is true, that the ſign of the Croſſe hath been anciently uſed by Chriſtians, as a mark of diſtinction, that they were neither Jewes nor heathens; but for worſhipping of it, or attributing vertue or merit to it, I read nothing, though I find it uſed by the confeſſion of Fathers, 1400 years agoe,

                  <p>He that is the head of the Church Catholike, generally God in Trinity, but more particularly Chriſt who is the Churches myſticall head, and ſhe is his body and kingdome, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.22. and the 4. <hi>cap. ver.</hi> 15, 16. and he governeth as her head principally, by the ſcepter of his word and ſpirit, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.13. Now thus Chriſt hath a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome naturall or diſpenſatorie. His naturall headſhip or kingdome, is that whereby he reigneth in unitie of eſſence with the Father and the holy Spirit from all eternity, which ſhall never have an end. The kingdome that he hath by diſpenſation, is that free and voluntary kingdome, which he received from God for the ſalvation of his Church, and ſhall in the end of the world be given up to God the Father again, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25, 28. in the mean time he is by diſpenſation the head and ſole monarch of the Church. But he hath nevertheleſſe a government miniſteriall, not only inviſible by his ſpirit and Angels, <hi>John</hi> 16.7. <hi>Heb.</hi> 1.14. but a viſible miniſtration by the word and wholeſome diſcipline, to the exerciſe whereof, ſome men are by his appointment delegated for the helping our infirmities, and ſpeaking to us in Chriſts abſence, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.1. And this hath alwaies been done by Biſhops and Presbyters, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.28. who by the Holy Ghoſt were made overſeers of the flock, not ſecular men, though Princes had ever this externall government in the diſpenſation of ſpirituall things committed to them; for then how was the Church ruled for 300 years after Chriſt, till the daies of <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> yet the ſecular power is to govern men as men, but the miniſters only governs them as Chriſtians, and therefore in this caſe Princes themſelves have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed ſubjection to this miniſteriall government of Chriſt, as the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Theodoſius,</hi> to St <hi>Ambroſe</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Millane.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Theod. <hi>lib.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 17.</note> Nor have any dared to uſurp their office without ſome exemplary puniſhment, as <hi>Uzzah</hi> and <hi>Uzziah,</hi> till theſe latter times,<note place="margin">2 Sam. 6.7.</note> wherein any tradeſman dare take upon him the office of a miniſter, and a ſeutor to be a ſoule member. Beſide, if this miniſteriall government were committed to ſecular powers, then they might give the Sacrament, and a woman if a Prince, might preach too, notwithſtanding St <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.34. But we find <hi>Jehoſaphat</hi> to diſtinguiſh the civill power,<note place="margin">2 Chro. 19.5.8.</note> from the eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtick miniſtry, in the Old Teſtament; and ſurely the Church of the New Teſtament was not left to confuſion in government, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. Therefore the ancient Fathers have reproved even Emperors,<note place="margin">

<pb n="266" facs="tcp:37858:152"/>in the practiſe of religion and vice, which is a ſcandall to reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; yea, and hereſies, blaſphemies and ſacriledge proved to be ſo, by Eccleſiaſticall judgement, but not to define points of faith, nor to exerciſe miniſteriall offices. It is true, that <hi>Moſes, Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and others, did exerciſe both offices many times, yet we cannot argue from an extraordinary action in a ſtate not fully ſetled, that it ſhould be ſo in a ſetled Church and State; for by the ſame reaſon a Prieſt may act the office of a Prince or a Judge at any time, as did <hi>Moſes, Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel.</hi> But we find when the Prieſthood was ſetled, that <hi>Moſes</hi> then medled not with <hi>Aarons</hi> buſineſſe, and <hi>Eli</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> were Judges by an extraordinary call in a corrupted State, but ordinarily it was otherwiſe. So in the New Teſtaments Church holy things were alwaies ordinarily and ordinately adminiſtred by Biſhops and Pres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byters, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12. to whom thoſe of the Church were to ſubmit themſelves, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. Nor was the Church governed by any one man, but by them, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.6. no not by <hi>Peter</hi> alone, though he was in that Councill: and the ancient Fathers decline that ſole definitive judicature,<note place="margin">Cypr. <hi>lib.</hi> 31 <hi>Epi.</hi> 19. <hi>ad</hi> Cletum.

Nor was the government of it democra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall, or in the power of the people, for then they muſt have this pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from themſelves, or from God: it cannot be from themſelves; for this power is not by right of nature, or Nations, but is ſupernaturall, and of divine right: nor have they it from God, for no Scripture ſets it forth, but therein they are called the flock which are to be fed, not to govern or chuſe their Shepherds. Yet it is true, they were preſent at the ordination of <hi>Matthias, Acts</hi> 1. and the ſeven Deacons, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. but they only named or deſigned them, but ordained them not: however ſuch a particular fact at firſt proveth not that it muſt be ſo alwaies, no more then becauſe the firſt Kings were choſen by the people, therefore they muſt be ſo alwaies. So that it ſeems to me that the Church mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant is neither democraticall, as governed by the people, nor monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chicall by any one man, but ariſtocraticall, that is, governed by ſome chiefe heads of the miniſtry.</p>
                  <p>Therefore the Pope can derive no ſuch power from <hi>Peter,</hi> as to be the head of the Church; for <hi>Peter</hi> was never ſo conſtituted by Chriſt, nor was ever ſo acknowledged by the reſt of the Apoſtles; for then they would never have contended who ſhould be chiefe, as they did, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.24.

<pb n="268" facs="tcp:37858:153"/>part of the Church viſible corrupted, and exalts himſelfe above all earthly power, that hath given to it the title of God or Lord, and ſhewing himſelfe as God,<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.4.</note> both in placing and diſplacing Kings, and forgiving ſins. So is the nature of his doctrine oppoſed to Chriſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſubtilly, namely, becauſe faith muſt appear by works, therefore to ſet up works to juſtifie our perſons, which works the popiſh writers call alſo the works of faith, not of the law, though they be but works of mens inventions, and ſo they prefer works before the formall righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe of Chriſt imputed to man for juſtification. <hi>Mahomet</hi> ſpeaks alſo very well of Chriſt, but he enjoins externall works of his own collection, by which men muſt be ſaved. So the Pope and <hi>Mahomet</hi> join in one againſt Chriſt in this, and alſo in holding that the holy Scriptures are not ſufficient for ſalvation, but their canons and rules of obedience have more attributed to them for performance, then the obedience of faith; which devices are like the locuſts that came out of the bottomleſſe pit of their inventions, <hi>Rev.</hi> 9. having the face of a reaſonable creature, but a ſcorpions ſting, which gives no reſt to the ſoule, but poiſons it; yet if hue and cry were made after the Pope and <hi>Mahomet,</hi> a man might juſtly ſtop the Pope upon ſuſpicion of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the more proper Antichriſt, for theſe reaſons. Firſt, becauſe the name of Antichriſt agreeth moſt properly to him and his ſeat; yea, all the deſcriptions of Antichriſt in Scripture, doth ſo likewiſe. But by the Pope we mean not every Biſhop of <hi>Rome</hi> from the Primitive times; for many of them were Confeſſors and Martyrs, till the time of <hi>Sylveſter,</hi> neither was Antichriſt diſcovered much, till <hi>Boniface</hi> the third took from the Emperor <hi>Phocas</hi> the name of Univerſall Biſhop, and his See of <hi>Rome</hi> to be called the ſupreme head of all Churches. After this we find in the Pope and Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> all the marks of Antichriſt; for he ſets in the Temple of God, like an Hornet in a Bee hive, driving out the labouring Bees, and devouring their hony. The popiſh writers make this an argument of their Church, being the true Church and Temple of God, becauſe Antichriſt ſits there. It is true that they have the name and ſhew of a Church Chriſtian, but have neither true Doctrine nor Sacraments in their ſimplicity, as the Scripture ſets them forth, and hath delivered them to the Church; ſo that they have only the name of a Church, as <hi>Sardis</hi> had, that ſhe was living, but indeed was dead, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.1. And in this Church Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt ſitteth as a uſurping Tyrant over Gods ordinances, abuſing them, and changing them at his pleaſure, and over all authority Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall and Civill, that beareth any ſimilitude of <hi>Elohim,</hi> even as St <hi>Paul</hi> foretold, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.3, 4. And this may be proved from their own writers; ſome of them ſaying that it is not lawfull for any man to reprove what the Pope approves; for all men ought to be judged by him,<note place="margin">Zodericus.

Again, he maintains the doctrine of devils by forbidding marriage and meats;<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1, 2, 3</note> and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains heatheniſme for true Religion, by commanding the worſhip of images, and the adoration of dead Saints, which was the practice of the heathens in worſhipping of their Daemons. Beſide this, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt doth equall, if not prefer the bleſſed Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> before Chriſt, as may be ſeen by the titles they give unto her; as the Turks ſet <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>homet</hi> above Chriſt. And farther, his religion is patched up of other petty Antichriſts, and therefore certainly he is the great Antichriſt: For as the <hi>Valentinian</hi> hereticks and <hi>Marcion,</hi> when they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed by Scripture, they ſaid that the Scriptures were inſufficient, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure, and of no authority; ſo do the Papiſts.<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>cont.</hi> Pelag.

So the Popes cruelty and tyranny is ſet forth in the ſecond Beaſt, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.11. like a lamb, but ſpake like a dragon, exerciſing it on true Chriſtians, as it is foretold, <hi>Rev.</hi> 13.15, 17. that all that would not worſhip the firſt beaſts image, that is, the Pope himſelfe, ſhould be killed, and that none ſhould buy or ſell, but ſuch as bore ſome mark of his obedience;<note place="margin">

<pb n="271" facs="tcp:37858:154"/>and perſecution, and Seat in <hi>Rome,</hi> became the image of the firſt Beaſt. It is ſimple to think that Antichriſt is one man, as it were to ſay that Iſrael were the name of one man only, whereas it is the name of a whole nation alſo. So <hi>Sion</hi> is the name of a hill, yet it ſignifieth alſo the Church. And it is as ſimple to ſay that Antichriſt muſt deny that Jeſus Chriſt in plain words, for then every man would detect him and deteſt him; neither could then his doctrine be called the myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of iniquity; nor could the great whore bear on her forehead pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the name Myſtery,<note place="margin">Rev. 17.5.</note> which in former time was written upon the Popes Myter, however it is now taken away, and put on the front of their religion.

The chiefe tokens that this Antichriſtian whore muſt be taken for <hi>Rome,</hi> the Popes ſeat, is plain.

And as this ſecond beaſt made fire to come down from heaven, ſo doth the Pope, by making that heavenly cenſure of excommunication and abſolution, ſtoop to his earthly pleaſure, and places of heavenly Scripture to ſerve his ſenſuall deſires. It is he that gave life to the image of the beaſt, that is, to that ſhape which he left to the Emperours, which he made to ſpeak what and when he pleaſed, for they became but his creatures, for he made them, and cauſed the people to make them at his pleaſure, yet but as images of Emperours, to what they had been. The ſeat of this Beaſt is <hi>Rome,</hi> which in St <hi>Johns</hi> time was built on ſeven hils, and if it be not ſo now,<note place="margin">Virgill.

                  <p>Firſt, many that are unbaptized, and but under the diſcipline of catechiſing, may be, and are members of the Church militant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe many ſuch are included in the covenant, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.39. as the Eunuch, <hi>Acts</hi> 8. and <hi>Cornelius, Acts</hi> 10. yea, <hi>Rahab</hi> in the Old Teſtament, men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.31. and the theefe crucified with Chriſt; and many were martyrs before they were baptized.

                     </note> though not viſible, becauſe they may have the baptiſme of fire and blood, though not of water. So we ſay that hereticks and apoſtates ſtubbornly continuing, ſuch are not of this Church, becauſe they have made ſhipwrack of faith, and therefore are to be ſhunned by the faithfull, being not of their ſociety, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 2.19. Yet we cannot deny them admittance upon their returning and repenting. And ſo we account of ſchiſmaticks,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Concil.</hi> Nicen. <hi>cap.</hi> 18, 19.</note> who rent themſelves off from the Church, Chriſts myſticall body, and ſo is no part of it, becauſe they break the union of members with the head, and one another, and therefore ſo ſtanding they cannot be members of the Church, no more then a branch rent from a tree can be part of the living tree; or a member cut from the body, to be part of the living body. So thoſe that are juſtly excommunicate in the right ſenſe of the Catholick Church, and have no mind to return, and to be reconciled, cannot be of the Church militant, becauſe ſuch want repentance, and love, and peace. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the whole Catholick Church cannot perſonally or actually ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communicate one, ſome think therefore that whether excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be inflicted juſtly or unjuſtly, one is but caſt out of the Church vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, or ſome particular Church. Indeed ſometimes it may very well be ſo; but if it be done by the rule of the whole Church, ſurely it is all one as if done by the whole, or the repreſentative body of the Church, becauſe the ſame ſpirit guideth any part (if they go by a true rule) which guideth the whole; as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.4. and therefore in anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent time,<note place="margin">

It is true, that a man unjuſtly excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is only caſt out of the viſible Church,<note place="margin">John 9.34, 35.</note> or particular Congregation, and therefore he retaining his faith and baptiſme, is nevertheleſſe a member of the Church militant; yea a man juſtly excommunicate, yet upon his repentance is a member of the Church militant, and ought to be admitted into the viſible Church, and particular Congregation, as was the inceſtuous perſon, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.7, 8. for the cenſure of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication is to ſuch a man only corrective,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 5.5.</note> not deſtructive: for though it be ſaid there for the deſtruction of the fleſh, yet I ſuppoſe that he was not delivered to Satan to be killed, but rather that he find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelfe caſt out of the Church, which is the kingdome of God, and ſo deprived of the benefits thereof conveied to men, by praier, word, and Sacrament, and ſo in the devils power, it might work in
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:37858:156"/>him a mortification of fleſhly concupiſcence by true repentance. Nor do we ſet open this Church door ſo wide, as to account reprobates of the Church militant, nor yet notorious ſinners without repentance: for the members of the Church militant are living ſtones, built upon the corner ſtone, Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Pet. 2 5.</note> in whom they are choſen and inrolled as his ſouldiers, and are Saints by efficacious calling, becauſe predeſtinated thereto, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.30. which reprobates are not. So manifeſt and noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſinners are not of the Church militant, becauſe they fight not againſt ſin, but ſubject themſelves to it, having not the ſpirit that lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteth againſt the fleſh, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. whereas in the members of the Church militant, Chriſt liveth by the holy ſpirit, deriving to them, ſenſe, life, and ſpirituall motion. Nor do we number hypocrites to be of the Church militant, though in the viſible Church by partaking of the doctrine and Sacraments, becauſe they want thoſe vertues and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which proves one to be a member of the myſticall body of Chriſt, as faith to apprehend Chriſt the head and foundation, and to be uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him, and therefore can bear no fruit in him, but muſt be taken away, <hi>Iohn</hi> 15.2. though they be in Church viſible; which Church the Papiſts only acknowledging, may well hold that the true Church is alwaies viſible.</p>

Firſt, for the univerſall company of beleevers, and ſo it is inviſible; and therefore it is ſaid in the Creed, I beleeve the holy Catholike Church: now faith is the evidence of things not ſeen. Secondly, Church is taken for a company of men in particular places, profeſſing one and the ſame true religion, and ſo it is viſible. Again, if you take the Church in the externall form of it, namely, for a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of men met together to perform Church duties; ſo the Church is viſible: but if you take it in its internall form, conſiſting in efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous calling, and faith; ſo it is inviſible: for it is hard to judge who hath theſe graces. Therefore certainly neither the whole Catholick Church, nor all that part of it called militant, is viſible.

When Antichriſt reigned over the world, where was then the Church viſible? ſurely fled, like the woman, <hi>Rev.</hi> 12.16. into ſome ſolitary place, as <hi>Eliah</hi> was forced to do by <hi>Ieſabel,</hi> 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 19.10.

So at the beginning, middle, and end of the world, and not all alike at all times, ſometimes clouded, ſometimes more reſplendent; ſo that it is not alwaies viſible, nor alwaies alike viſible.</p>

                  <p>Yes; for <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve</hi> fell in Paradiſe, and afterward the world was ſo wicked, that the Church remained only in <hi>Noahs</hi> fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And after God had choſen the people of Iſrael to be his Church, they worſhipped the golden Calfe; and for that and other ſins, we find them left without Religion, Prieſt, or Law, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 5. and their Temple ruin'd, and themſelves diſperſed. Chriſt ſaith, that faith ſhal hardly be found on the earth;<note place="margin">2 Theſ. 2.</note> and St <hi>Paul</hi> prophecieth of a generall apoſtacy. So in the time of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the Chriſtian world was over-run with Arianiſme, only <hi>Athanaſius</hi> ſtood for Chriſt, that he was of the ſame ſubſtance with the Father. But he was but one man, and one man could not make a Church; ſo that the Church as well as the Moon, may ſuffer an eclipſe, eſpecially when the ſword ſhall awake againſt the ſhepherd, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13.7. and he ſhall be ſmitten, and the ſheep ſcattered. So likewiſe the viſible Church may erre, not the Church Catholick and univerſall; for truth could not be found then upon earth, nor any viſible militant Church, for then they have no truth to fight for. But the viſible Church as it conſiſteth of its outward matter and form, namely, of a company of men exerciſed about Eccleſiaſticall matters may erre, and ſo it did before the Law in the time of the Patriarks, and under the Law, as the Church of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, and ſince the Law. For the viſible Church of the Jewes perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Chriſtians: and the Diſciples were all offended and ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at Chriſts ſufferings, and hardly beleeved at firſt, his reſurrection; yea, and after, it erred about his Kingdome, <hi>Acts</hi> 1.6. which they thought ſhould be earthly. So they doubted a while about the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of the Gentiles, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.20. <hi>cap.</hi> 11.2. So we find the Church of the <hi>Corinths</hi> full of diviſion,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.11.</note> and ſchiſmes, and doubts of the reſurrection of the dead, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and the Church of <hi>Galatia</hi> falling back to Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daiſme by circumciſion.<note place="margin">Gal. 5.1, 2, 3.</note> Yea, all the Eaſtern Churches, as wel as the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven Churches of the leſſer <hi>Aſia,</hi> have had their errors, and remaine in ſome, as the Papiſts ſay, even till now. Yea, generall Councils have not been free; for one hath diſallowed what the other hath allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and both cannot therefore be true.

                  <p>I ſuppoſe you mean particular Churches in ſeverall nations. For the univerſall Catholike Church, is rather to be beleeved then ſeen, as is implied in that Article of the Creed, I beleeve the holy Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church. There be therefore three notes of a true viſible Church. Firſt, a ſincere preaching of the Word. Secondly, a pure diſpenſation of Sacraments. And thirdly, a right adminiſtration of
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:37858:157"/>diſcipline. Theſe are the notes of a true Church, though all of them are not ſound alwaies, and at the ſame time in a Church. As the Jewes for forty years in the wilderneſſe wanted circumciſion: ſo ſometime ſome miniſters may poſſibly through ignorance, infirmity or fear, or to pleaſe greatneſſe, depart from ſincere doctrine; and ſo by the dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons taile many ſtars are caſt to the earth, and by ſome of them the waters are made bitter, <hi>Rev.</hi> 8.11. yet may it be a true Church, ſo long as the diſceſſion from pure doctrine is not generall. So a Church may by miniſters neglect, want Sacraments, and by the tyranny of Princes, want diſcipline; yet if the Church be purely viſible, it hath ordinarily theſe three notes, which indeed freeth it from maintaining error, he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie, and ſchiſme, though all three may poſſibly be in it,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1.11. and cap. 3.3</note> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.19. provided alwaies that the hereſie thruſt it not into infidelity, or cauſe it not to deprave the doctrines of faith, as the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> hath, and ſo is become adulterous and hereticall. So it may be in ſome things ſchiſmaticall, ſo far as to hurt charity, not verity, by taking oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion unjuſtly, as the Separatiſts, to depart from the Church, but not giving occaſion to the Church, to depart from them, as the Papiſts have done to us, like the old Phariſees, who gave juſt occaſion to Chriſt and his Apoſtles, to ſeparate themſelves from their traditions. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore true doctrine is the chiefe note of a true viſible Church, whereby people are taught as Chriſts ſheep, to hear his voice, <hi>John</hi> 10.27. and to continue in his, and his Apoſtles doctrine, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.42. which is the foundation of the Church, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.20. And for the Sacraments, they are commanded by Chriſt himſelfe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. and <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19. So alſo is the adminiſtration of diſcipline ſet down by our Saviour, <hi>Mat.</hi> 18.17. and uſed by St <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.5. upon the inceſtuous perſon. So that the right uſe of theſe muſt needs be a note of a true viſible Church. Let the Papiſts brag of their tearm Catholike, I am ſure it no way agreeth to them, neither in reſpect of the extenſion of their Churches bounds, which is not univerſall, nor yet in regard of their doctrines, which are not according to the Catholike truths confeſſed by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive, or orthodox Churches of old, and therefore their word Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like is no note: for a true viſible Church is not to be judged by a name, but by the thing it ought to hold; otherwiſe, the Pope like <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> might be thought the great power of God, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.10. Nor doth their boaſted antiquity make their Church the more true: for many things were ſaid of old, which were not intended at the firſt, as they were afterward uſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5. It is not antiquity, but his truth that is the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient of daies, that is the note of the Church.<note place="margin">

<pb n="278" facs="tcp:37858:158"/>of <hi>Rome</hi> hath not had a continued duration; for <hi>Bellarmin</hi> ſaith, that a Church cannot ſubſiſt without a Biſhop, and the ſeat of <hi>Rome</hi> hath been often vacant by wars and ſchiſms among the Popes themſelves, as hath been formerly ſhewed you. Nor doth their amplitude and multitudes make any thing in this caſe for them; for Satans King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome is larger then Chriſts, and his numbers more then Chriſts little flock, who are often like <hi>Noahs</hi> family in the Ark; they have a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the vulgar,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The true Chriſtian Proteſtant Church; eſpecially as it was conſtituted by the firſt reforming Princes in <hi>England:</hi> for the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thereof is built upon the holy ſcripture. They adminiſter Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments in their primitive purity, and hold only two generally neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, <hi>i.</hi> Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, rejecting all the ſpurious Sacraments of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> As confirmation, which the Church of <hi>England</hi> did uſe in a laudable manner, and might do much good by uſing it as it was, but not as a Sacrrment; for it kept young people in a care to render an account of their faith; and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and Parents to teach them Catechiſme. So pennance was injoined notorious offenders for ſatisfaction of the Church, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce them better manners, and to beget fear and ſhame in others, but never held it a Sacrament, no more then it did matrimony or ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. As for the fift ſpurious Sacrament of <hi>Rome,</hi> extreme unction, they never uſed it, becauſe not inſtituted of Chriſt as a Sacrament. It is true, <hi>Mark</hi> 6.13. the Diſciples anointed many that were ſick, with oile, and they were healed, and St <hi>James</hi> in <hi>cap.</hi> 5.14. adviſeth them to uſe oile with praier for the ſick; but it was no conſecrated oile, as the papiſts uſe,<note place="margin">

                  <p>The participation of thoſe benefits to which the Saints only have a right in common: and this communion they have with God, and of his benefits among themſelves. That they have a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with God, you may ſee, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.3, 7. by which we have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion and union with him, by love of him towards us, and our love to him and his word and ſervice; and ſo as it were cohabiting and dwelling one in and with another, <hi>Iohn</hi> 14.23. as a father with his children by providence, &amp; children with their father by a loving obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience. And this communion is expreſs in Scripture particularly with the bleſſed Trinity. As firſt with the father by being made his ſons, 1 <hi>Iohn</hi> 3.1. through Chriſt by faith, <hi>Iohn</hi> 1.12. and by the vertue of the Holy Ghoſt, who leadeth us into all ſaving truth, <hi>Iohn</hi> 16.13. and te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth to us that we are the children of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.16, 17. For as the Father by his love to us, draweth us to Chriſt, <hi>Iohn</hi> 6.44. ſo Chriſt dwels in our heart by faith, <hi>Eph.</hi> 3.12. and the ſpirit acteth and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecteth this union and communion by his operation through his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall graces, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.14. Therefore as God the Father hath given us his Son, ſo his Son hath united our nature to himſelfe, by an union in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſoluble, as a body and members to the head, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.12. So the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt doth combine him and the Saints, by a true and reall union and communion of his ſubſtance, not by his body being in ours, or ours in his, but as the branches are in the vine, which though differing in ſight, yet agree in connexion, communication, and aſſimulation. By this ſpirit we have communion with Chriſts divine nature, becauſe it dwels in us, and conforms us to it ſelfe, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.4. and alſo with his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, as children are partakers of the ſame fleſh &amp; blood, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. yea, of the ſame ſpirit, 1. <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.17. and of his ſufferings alſo, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.17. that we may be glorified with him. For by the union we have with Chriſt, is obtained all the benefits of his birth, death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion, ſpoken of before, together with all the bleſſed effects thereof wronght in us, as free juſtification, regeneration, adoption, and freedome from ſin, ſatan, and the ſinfull world, with all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quents thereof, which is remiſſion of ſin, reſurrection of our bodies, and life eternall; all which is ſealed to us by the two Sacraments,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:37858:159"/>Baptiſme and the Lords Supper, by both which we have communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with Chriſt; for all that are baptized into Chriſt, have put on Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. and the cup of bleſſing, and the ſacramentall bread, is the blood and body of Chriſt to faith, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16.</p>

                  <p>He that did firſt inſtitute them, knew beſt the reaſon of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing two; and the Scripture, which is the expreſſe mind of Chriſt, ſets forth baptiſme to us, as the Sacrament of initiation or entrance, or firſt grafting into Chriſt and his myſticall body the Church. The other as the Sacrament of ſuſtentation, by which we are with the word, nouriſhed up to life eternall. Therefore St <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 6.5. cals baptiſme a planting into the ſimilitude of Chriſts death, and <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.17. he ſaith the Gentiles were grafted into the true olive, which no doubt was at firſt by the word of faith preached, and baptiſme recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. And the Sacrament of the communion, is repreſented to us as food, to which Chriſt had ſome reſpect, <hi>John</hi> 6.55. ſaying, my fleſh is meat indeed, though he explains it afterward in a ſpirituall ſenſe, <hi>ver.</hi> 63. ſaying, the ſpirit quickneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing. It is true that there is no clear analogy between grafting and waſhing, except we conſider the ſubject of that Sacrament in divers reſpects. 1. As a wild tree, and ſo by baptiſme one is ſaid to be grafted, becauſe it is a means ordained for our admittance into the ſtock. 2. If we conſider man as a polluted infant in birth naturall, ſo waſhing is proper, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.4, 5. and therefore baptiſme is called the waſhing of regeneration, or the new birth, and differs as much from the other Sacrament in the thing ſignified, as in the ſign; for the ſign of one is water, of the other wine. So the thing ſignified in the one, is the all-cleanſing ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, <hi>John</hi> 3.5. which in effectuall baptiſme operates with the water; the thing ſignified by the other, is the all-cleanſing blood of Chriſt: not but that both are in both; the blood of Chriſt concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring with baptiſme, through the efficacy of it (though not ſignified by it) and the Holy Ghoſt in the communion by his powerfull opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, conveying the efficacy of his body and blood to every belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.</p>

                     <hi>Though Baptiſme be but the Sacrament of entrance, yet there be many tender minds who cannot comfortally bring children to it, as there be many being fearfull of their own unworthineſs, and to partake with ſuch as are not fit, as they ſuppoſe, to abſtain from the Lords Table.

                  <p>The New Teſtament ſets down two rules: Chriſt bids us do it in remembrance of him: St <hi>Paul</hi> bids us to examine our ſelves, and ſhewes the danger of the neglect, that it incurs judgement, and the reaſon of that danger, becauſe for want of examination we diſcern not the Lords body. By all which we may find what is the duty of a true communicant, which no doubt conſiſts in a right knowledge of the myſtery of it, and a true faith in the application of it; both which to examine, is our preparation. Therefore we are to conſider, Firſt, the thing it ſelfe. Secondly, the relation that it hath to Chriſt. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the end of it. Fourthly, the fitneſſe of a receiver.</p>
                  <p>The thing it ſelfe is a viſible earneſt of an inviſible good, expected by faith in Chriſt, to whom we have right through his word, of which the Sacrament is a ſeale. In this Chriſt hath ſhewed his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundant love, that he would not only make himſelfe viſible to us, by
<pb n="283" facs="tcp:37858:160"/>taking our nature, but alſo humble himſelfe to our ſenſe of taſting and feeling, that we may not only ſee, but taſte and handle the word of life: ſo that though he be gone far from us, and above us in the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion hypoſtaticall, having taken our manhood into God, yet he is with us by an union ſacramentall, that we may take him into our ſelves, and by vertue thereof, be transformed to his likeneſſe, in righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe and holineſſe. The next thing to conſider, is the relation the Sacrament hath to Chriſt. Firſt in the elements. Secondly the actions of the receiver. The elements are mean and plain, bread and wine, the common food of the pooreſt man in that Country where it was firſt inſtituted. But the element is made excellent by the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutor, Chriſt, as ſometimes coins of baſe mettall are made valuable by the power of Kings, and a ſmall piece of parchment by law, ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled to convey an inheritance. The elements are mean and poor, the better to reſemble him that had neither form nor beauty in his paſſion; and alſo to ſet forth his power, who can do wonders and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles by weak means; yet they be doubled, to confirm our comfort; and they be the elements of our ſuſtentation, to preſent to us his vertue, by which the ſoule is nouriſhed to everlaſting life. Next we are to conſider what relation the actions of Chriſt in the conſecration hath to himſelfe, and of the receiver to Chriſt, namely, in that he ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth and drinketh the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>The actions of Chriſt in his conſecration of the elements to a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall uſe, are, Firſt, his taking and bleſſing of the elements, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.19, 20. There is another cup named in the 17 verſe, which was only the cup of thankſgiving uſed by the Jewes in all their ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn feaſts. But this was the cup of bleſſing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.16. the cup of the New Teſtament in his blood, which bleſſing cauſed it to ceaſe from being a common drink, and to become ſacramentall, ſignifying that he took our nature, and ſanctified it to undertake the work of redemption, and yet altered not the elements in their nature, but uſe; not in their ſubſtance, but efficacy, no more then he altered the nature of man by taking it into the deity, though he advanced it in quality above the common capacity of humane nature. So he brake it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Aug.</hi> tom. <hi>8.</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> &amp; tom. <hi>9.</hi> tract <hi>7.</hi> in Ep. <hi>Johannis.</hi>
                     </note> to ſhew what violence ſhould be uſed to his body; and poured out the wine, to ſet forth the effuſion of his blood. So he gave it to his diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to ſhew that he freely beſtowed himſelfe upon the Church, with all his merits.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, we are to conſider in the actions of the receiver, what relation they have to Chriſt. Their action is taking, eating, drinking. Taking ſhewes the beleevers hand of faith apprehending Chriſt. Then he eats and drinks the Sacrament, to ſignifie the benefit we get by Chriſt, whoſe precious death is exhibited to us in the Sacrament, and proves to us, either like phyſick to prevent evill, or to purge us of it, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.7. or elſe is like ordinary food to ſuſtain us, or like dainty meat to refreſh and reſtore us. Again, it is eaten and drunk, to ſhew that he is like meat, without which we cannot live, and after which we ſhould moſt earneſtly long, and eagerly deſire, as hungry men do after victuals; as alſo to ſhew what conformity our ſpirituall ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:37858:161"/>hath with Chriſt: for as that which we eat is retained, if it agree with our ſtomack, elſe it is repelled: ſo if our ſtomacks ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall do agree with Chriſt, we retaine him becauſe he agreeth with it, and pleaſeth it, and contents it, which the world doth not. Beſide, it is eaten and drunk, to ſhew that Chriſt muſt incorporate with us; not that we turn him into our nature, as we do other meat, but by our receiving him, he turneth our nature to his likeneſſe: as leaven doth turn the bread into its own likeneſſe, the bread doth not turn it, and in this reſpect the Kingdome of God is like a leven, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13. By this is alſo ſet forth that rare union that we have with Chriſt, he concor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porating himſelfe with us by faith in a wonderfull manner:<note place="margin">Aug. <hi>Ep.</hi> 23. Aug. <hi>in tract.</hi> 26. <hi>in</hi> Joh.</note> for though we eat him not with our mouth, yet we do by our mind. Therefore Chriſt ſaid, take, eat, this is my body, which indeed is not his body till it be eaten, nor then his naturall, but his ſacramentall bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, which men feed on by faith, and not by ſenſe; by which faith Chriſt is there preſent to every beleever, and that not only by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite and unlimited preſence, by which he filleth all places; nor by that reall preſence which the Lutherans imagine, as if Chriſts body did partake of the incommunicable properties of the deity, ſuch as ubiquity, by which they beleeve Chriſt to be in or under the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: nor is Chriſt preſent in the Sacrament by the change of the elements into his body, as the papiſts hold. A ſtrange opinion, to make Chriſt ſubject to orall eating, and gutterall ſwallowing, and to make God do things not only contrary to nature (which all men grant he can) but things contrary in nature, which he cannot do, becauſe that implieth a contradiction. As we read that God made the Sun and Moon ſtand ſtill, it was contrary to nature: But he never did, nor never will, make the Sun to ſtand and go at one and the ſame inſtant: ſo neither make Chriſts body infinite like the deity to be every where at one time. Nor certainly will he ſo far debaſe the body of Chriſt, as to make it a generall food for all in the Sacrament, which was intended only for the ſpirituall nouriſhment of the faithfull. And farther, Chriſt is preſent energetically, <hi>i.</hi> by vertue and power; ſo he is among thoſe that are gathered together in his name, by the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of his holy ſpirit; but in the Sacrament he is relatively preſent, as being repreſented thereby; as Kings are in their officers of State, whoſe act is counted as the Kings own, though he be perſonally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent in his Court only.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Amb.</hi> de Incar. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                     </note> So when his body was in the grave, his vertue wrought from heaven to quicken it: ſo now his body though in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, yet his power worketh in every faithfull receiver; as the Sun en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightneth the eie, though the body of the Sun be in heaven. Again, our eating and drinking the Sacrament, muſt intimate to us, that as food makes a uniting continue between ſoule and body, ſo doth the Sacrament between Chriſt and us by faith; and as food doth more ſtrongly unite one member to another, ſo doth the Sacrament one member myſticall of Chriſt to another by love, becauſe we being many are one bread, and one body, being all partakers of that one bread; and as by one ſpirit we are all baptized into one body, ſo we all have been made to drink into one ſpirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.13. that ſo we
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:37858:161" rendition="simple:additions"/>having all one food of life, ſo we be of one mind and ſouſe, and one affection, which is the ſpirit of life. Moreover, by partaking of this Sacrament by eating and drinking, is ſealed to us our right to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, as ſure as that which we eat is our own, and concorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated with us. Therefore it is the duty of a communicant, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der how he underſtands the end of the Sacrament, and the effects of it, that ſo he may not receive only, but perceive the Lords body, and ſo do it in remembrance of him. In which duty it is required that we remember his death, and the benefits thereof, which not being done, the Sacrament is ſlighted and profaned, becauſe that to which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates, hath no impreſſion in us, as by remembring his love expreſſed to us in his death, than which none could be greater, being endured for us while we were enemies, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. or the horrour of his death being moſt painfull, ſhamefull, fearfull, enduring not only the ſpight of wicked men, but an abſtraction of the divine comfort for a time, ſo that never was ſorrow like his, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.12. all which was moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly due to us; nor remembring the benefits of his death, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us; as by it the ſting of death is taken away, though a ſtain is left; the curſe of the law is aboliſhed, it is to us no killing letter; the exaction of the law is nullified, we being not bound to every jot and tittle of it for our juſtification, but our weak performances are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God in Chriſt, becauſe we have a right to all Chriſts righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, and a juſt claim in him to all the bleſſings of the law; ſo that neither the corruption of nature can reign over us,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> nor ſin bind us over to puniſhment everlaſting, and for temporall afflictions they ſhall all work to our good and glory, as they did to Chriſts, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.9.</p>

                  <p>Theſe do one include the other. For as faith looks upon Chriſt and his benefits, ſo remembrance cals thoſe things to mind, which faith beleeves; ſo that this remembrance muſt be a beleeving remembrance, that the Sacrament preſents to us under ſeal, the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits of Chriſts death and paſſion. It alſo muſt be a thankfull remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance for thoſe ineſtimable favours of which I told you. Next it muſt be an obedient remembrance to what he hath commanded, and now God in him entreats us to do out of love.</p>
                  <p>By all which you may diſcern how a communicant muſt be quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and in what he muſt eſpecially examine himſelfe, namely, in faith, which is the ſpeciall condition of the covenant of grace, of which the Sacrament is a ſeale. Now faith muſt be conſidered in the cauſe, the nature, and the effects of it. The cauſes of faith are the word, which is the ſeed of it, and the ſpirit which is the vertue of this ſeed, both theſe brings light to diſcover the darkneſs of our naturall eſtate, and the comfort in Goſpell light. Then next a power to regulate and conform us to its own rules, and to ſubdue all oppoſition, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. Now for the nature of faith, it being convinced that the word is of divine authority, it gives both an intellectuall aſſent to the truth of it, becauſe God doth avouch it, and a fiduciall aſſent to the goodneſſe
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:37858:162"/>of it for our own ſalvation; and as to the Word, ſo to the Sacrament, which is the ſeal thereof; which goodneſſe breedeth in us a love, lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and delight in the holy myſteries. Upon which followeth an heavenly and holy effect of faith: as to deſire and hunger after the food of the ſoule, and a ſtrong converſion of it into our ſoules nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and growing in grace by the ſtrength of it more and more, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13. 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. Next a ſympathy with Chriſts members in their griefs and joies. Then a readineſſe to every good work, and a ſtrong repulſe of evill: upon which followeth affiance in God, hope in his promiſes, peace of conſcience, and joy in the holy Ghoſt, and a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuall fructification in an holy life, by the ſtrength of the Word and Sacrament, while we walk here in this wilderneſſe of ſin, as the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites did in the ſtrength of Manna and the Rock-water, till we come to the land of everlaſting reſt.</p>

                  <p>Surely the learned are more to be truſted for the ſoule, as a learned Phyſitian for the body; but they go by rule, others by rote; ſo do theſe mechanick preachers, they deſpiſe learning, as ſome do riches, becauſe they deſpaire to get, and ſo they entitle the ſpirit to their ignorance, of which the ſpirit is no author, but the devill, and mans preſumptuous ſins: for the ſpirit never imploied any about his Church, but either he made them able by infuſion (which they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prove he hath them) or elſe by acquiſition. He gave <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the tongue of the learned, as well as <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Aholiab</hi> the gift of han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicraft. So Chriſt took plain men to preach his Goſpell, but he made them learned by the gifts of the Holy Ghoſt, which he hath not done theſe. So he imploied <hi>Paul</hi> the learned, and <hi>Luke</hi> the Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitian. So the Lord allowed ſchools for the Prophets, as we do Aca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demies to be as medicines for the rude manners of the people. If theſe men had more learning, they would ſee they wanted more, but having none, they find none they want. But however let them prove they have the ſpirit without learning, the able miniſter ſhall prove he hath the ſpirit by learning; as one may ſhew his faith by his works more evidently then another can ſhew faith without them.</p>

                     <hi>But why do you adviſe me to the publike meeting places, as Churches, rather than to chambers and conventicles, ſurely one is as holy as the other, is it not?</hi>

                  <p>Yes, in reſpect of any inherent holineſſe in them; for nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath any, but the Church hath the holineſſe of dedication and ſeparation from all other uſe, as the Jewes Temple had, till the abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination that maketh deſolate was ſet there, <hi>i.</hi> the Roman ſouldier. And therefore God looketh it ſhould be uſed with diſcrimination; for holineſſe becommeth his houſe for ever, and ſure a decent hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſſe and behaviour, doth not miſ-become it. But I do adviſe you to Churches the rather then chambers, becauſe Chriſt hath fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warned you of ſeeking him in the private chambers, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.26.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>But I ſee as much diſorder in Gods ſervice there, as in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, both in ſervice and at the Communion by divers geſtures.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>The more pitty; for they that pretend to ſanctifie Gods name, ought to make an holy diſcrination between thoſe things that are called by his name, and other things that are not. As Gods word, and Gods houſe, and the Lords table. I confeſſe in ſome things people may be borne withall; as not kneeling at praiers, when the Church and ſeats are ſo full that they cannot do it. So at the Communion every Church have thought fit to have one geſture by themſelves, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe people come to the Communion with one faith, to feed upon one Chriſt, and in one love and charity. So ſome Churches beyond the ſeas ſtand, ſome walk, ſome ſit; the Engliſh Church was wont to kneele. Now ſince our diſcipline is diſſolved, all theſe forrein ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtures are crept into our Church, and being there is no power to reduce them to their priſtine geſtures, miniſters can do no more then to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct them to be well ſatisfied in their own minds, and to have a cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:37858:163"/>opinion of them. For it may be they that receive it ſtanding, look on it in relation to the Paſſeover, a type thereof, which was eaten ſtanding. They that take it walking, conceive it as a viaticum, or a refreſhment in their journie, towards the land of eternall reſt. They that take it ſitting, look upon it as a ſpirituall banquet ſet before them to feed upon by faith. They that kneel, conceive it as a pardon ſealed and delivered to them of God, and ſo think good to take it kneeling. By this charitable conſtruction, one Church or Chriſtian ſhall not condemn another for a thing indifferent.</p>

                  <p>They that will allow none, deny the fourth Commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which requires a morall Sabbath. They that will not have the Lords day, underſtand not the ſenſe of that Commandement, which bindeth not all men to the ſeventh, which the Jewes kept but to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth. For the Jewes themſelves ſeem to me to have the ſeventh day from the creation altered, as well as the beginning of the year at the Paſſeover, of which <hi>Moſes</hi> gives a reaſon, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.15. in repetition of the Commandement, ſaying, becauſe God delivered thee out of Egypt, therefore he commanded thee to keep the Sabbath day. Nor do we find a Sabbath day kept, till the reigning of Manna, but that they marched one day as well as another; yet if the day from the creation was altered by a new deſignation of a day, yet the law was not broken, which only intended a ſeventh day reſt from ſix daies la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, whenſoever God ſhould preſcribe or fix the day to begin. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is the law broken by Chriſtians, becauſe the day is altered; for the intent of the law is kept, which bindeth to keep holy one in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, only the day is altered upon good ground: for as the Jewes kept their day in remembrance of Gods delivering them from <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh;</hi> ſo the Chriſtians keep one in ſeven, <hi>i.</hi> the firſt day of the week in remembrance of Chriſts deliverance of them by his reſurrection from ſatan, ſin, and death, and ſo hath performed indeed to us, what was but typed forth to the Jewes, by whoſe Holy daies and Sabbaths, we are not now to be judged, <hi>Col.</hi> 11.16, 17.</p>

Concerning hell I have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſhewed you. That there muſt be a reſurrection, there needs no proofe, ſince the wicked muſt be puniſhed, and the juſt rewarded, which commonly falleth out contrary in this world, and that many things may be revealed which yet lie hid, as well ſacred myſteries, as myſteries of iniquity, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.16. And for heaven no doubt it is the place of felicity, where Gods elect ſhall enjoy eternall life, whither Chriſt is gone before to prepare a place for them; the happineſſe of which place is called by St <hi>Paul</hi> our houſe from heaven, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency of the inheritance is ſet down by the name of crowns and
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:37858:163"/>kingcomes, and an eternall weight of glory, of which unbeleevers muſt look for no part, but ſuch as have fought a good fight againſt corruptions, and kept the faith in a pure conſcience; which God of his mercy give you and I grace to do, through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, to whom I commend you, and ſo take leave for this time, becauſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant occaſion cals me away.</p>
